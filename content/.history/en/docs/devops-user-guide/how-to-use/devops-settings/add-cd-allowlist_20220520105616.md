In KubeSphere 3.3.0, you can set an allowlist so that only specific code repositories and deployment locations can be used for continuous deployment.

## Prerequisites

- You have a workspace, a DevOps project and a user (`project-regular`) invited to the DevOps project with the `operator` role. If they are not ready yet, please refer to [Create Workspaces, Projects, Users and Roles](../../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/).

- You need to [enable the KubeSphere DevOps system](../../../../pluggable-components/devops/).

- You need to [import an code repository](../../../../devops-user-guide/how-to-use/code-repositories/import-code-repositories/).

## Procedures

1. Log in to the KubeSphere console as `project-regular`. In the navigation pane on the left, click **DevOps Projects**.

2. On the **DevOps Projects** page, click the DevOps project you created.

3. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **DevOps Project Settings > Basic Information**。

4. 在右侧的**Continuous Deployment Allowlist**区域，点击**Enable Allowlist**。

5. 在弹出的**Edit Allowlist**对话框，选择代码仓库和部署位置，点击**OK**。您可以继续点击**Add**以添加多个代码仓库和部署位置。
