In 2021, we have witnessed emerging cloud-native technologies, technological innovations, and the power of the open source community. We have also accomplished a lot of milestones with the collaboration of all users, contributors, and partners.

Let's take a look back at the milestones and story of the KubeSphere community over the past year and appreciate all the members who have contributed to the KubeSphere community.

## The state of projects under the KubeSphere umbrella

Over the past 3 years, the KubeSphere community has spawned many new open source projects centered around KubeSphere, such as KubeKey, OpenELB, and OpenFunction, all of which have been widely used by users worldwide. They can be integrated into KubeSphere not only as addons, but also as standalone projects used with Kubernetes. These projects have joined the CNCF Landscape, contributing to the prosperity of the cloud-native ecosystem.

In addition to the rapidly growing metrics of GitHub Star, Fork, and Contributor, the value and potential of the community behind these open source projects is immeasurable. In 2021, the KubeSphere community also donated the OpenELB and Fluent Operator to the CNCF and upstream Fluent community, polishing the projects and growing the community engagement under the umbrella of CNCF and the upstream community.

## User Adoption

According to telemetry statistics, KubeSphere has been downloaded 700,000 times worldwide, with nearly 80,000 active clusters and thousands of enterprises using KubeSphere in production. We've seen KubeSphere adopted by users in a variety of industries, including banking, insurance, securities, internet, energy, telecom, transportation, universities, retail, logistics, etc. Many experienced users have also helped the KubeSphere project by submitting suggestions or feedback and contributing to the code and documentation. 

In addition, we see an increasing number of users evangelizing and promoting KubeSphere at community events, technical articles, and on social media.

## Known Contributing Enterprises and Partners

We are grateful to see more and more enterprises contributing to KubeSphere and its ecosystem projects in the past year. At the same time, we have built partnership with the fast-growing enterprises and technical giants to create joint solutions and enrich the application ecosystem. For example, six cloud-native applications (APISIX, ChaosMesh, Nocalhost, JuiceFS, EdgeMesh, fpga-operator) had been added to KubeSphere App Store by our partners.

## Integration with Cloud Providers

As a unified control plane for multi-cloud and multi-cluster management, KubeSphere can easily import and manage private and hosted Kubernetes clusters. In 2021, KubeSphere is available on AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, and QingCloud, integrating Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, DigitalOcean Kubernetes, and QingCloud QKE, respectively.
