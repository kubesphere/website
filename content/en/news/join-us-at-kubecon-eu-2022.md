Every year, the Cloud-Native Computing Foundation organizes its flagship conference KubeCon and CloudNativeCon, which gathers DevOps, SRE, developers, and technologists to meet leading open source and Cloud-Native communities. This year, KubeCon and CloudNativeCon Europe are just around the corner! KubeSphere Team will bring 3 sessions in KubeCon EU and its co-related event FluentCon in this conference. You can join virtually from 16-20 May 2022. 

## Session 1: Empower Autonomous Driving with Cloud Native Serverless Technologies

### Abstract

For an Autonomous-Driving platform, the complex use cases and numerous modules pose huge challenges to the entire architecture. Taking data-archiving as an example, large amounts of time-sensitive data are generated in the vehicle and cloud every second, scattering in various devices and clusters. Challenges like multi-types of storage media, non-uniform data size, mixed asynchronous operations, steep resource overhead curves all prompt for a more flexible, elastic, and cost-saving architecture.

In this talk, UISEE developers and OpenFunction maintainers will talk about the following topics: 

- Why does Autonomous-Driving need a modern FaaS platform powered by Dapr, Keda, and Knative? 
- Cloud Native FaaS Platform OpenFunction Intro. 
- Why is an asynchronous function a good fit for Autonomous-Driving? 
- How does UISEE use the Asynchronous functions in Autonomous-Driving? 
- The benefits that a modern FaaS platform brings to Autonomous-Driving. 
- OpenFunction updates & roadmap.

## Session 2: Fluent Operator Intro and Deep Dive

**Please note: this session will be hosted as a workshop at FluentCon**
### Abstract

With the support of Fluentd, the original Fluent Bit Operator has been renamed to Fluent Operator. In this session, Fluent Operator maintainers will elaborate on the key features of Fluent Operator as well as its design principles and architecture,  including:

1. From Fluent Bit Operator to Fluent Operator.
2. Fluent Operator design principles.
3. Fluent Operator Architecture.
4. Use Fluent Bit as a light-weight logging agent on Kubernetes.
5. Use Fluentd as a global log forwarding & aggregation layer on Kubernetes.
6. Build a flexible and multi-tenant log processing pipeline for Kubernetes with Fluent Bit and Fluentd.
7. Demo.
8. Community & Roadmap.

## Session 3: Build a Cloud Native Logging Pipeline on the Edge with Fluent Operator

### Abstract

Fluent Operator, formerly known as Fluentbit Operator, provides great flexibility in building a logging layer based on Fluent Bit and Fluentd. It was created by the KubeSphere community to solve the following problems: 

1. Collect K8s logs through a light-weighted agent like Fluent Bit 
2. Control Fluent Bit via Kubernetes API 
3. Update configuration without rebooting Fluent Bit and Fluentd pods
4. Multi-tenant log isolation
5. Deploy and destroy Fluent Bit DaemonSet and Fluentd StatefulSet automatically.

Fluent Operator has reached its maturity level gradually and released v1.0.0-rc.0, with Fluentd and new plugins supported. It has become the subproject of the Fluent community for several months.  

In this talk, Feynman Zhou will talk about the architecture and new design of Fluent Operator, and demonstrate how to use Fluent Operator on K3s to process logs for the edge and IoT scenarios.
