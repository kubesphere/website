We are celebrating the milestone of reaching 10,000 GitHub stars for our open source project KubeSphere. This moment marks a great achievement on our journey to cloud native distributed OSs!

We want to thank you all, from every contributor, user, to follower for your trust, support, and help for KubeSphere.

In **2018**, we wrote down the first line of code for the KubeSphere project. Over the past four years, we improved our service nonstop, with more than 10 versions iterated and significant features updated in each major version. This witnessed how we transformed from a startup to an industry influencer.

Growing from a lesser-known project, KubeSphere has been ranked **second** among open source container projects worldwide. Initially, KubeSphere was known to a limited number of people, some of whom even didn’t know how KubeSphere could simplify the use of Kubernetes. Thanks to years of development, KubeSphere has won users worldwide, across more than **100** countries and regions, with nearly **one million** downloads, 300 contributors, and more than **1,500** GitHub forks of the main repository.

KubeSphere is committed to empowering enterprises to implement cloud native architectures. The very essence of this project is to build a cloud native distributed OS that can facilitate enterprises in deploying container platforms on heterogeneous infrastructures such as the cloud, virtual machines, and physical servers. This demonstrates how KubeSphere can enable agile development and full lifecycle management for cloud native applications. 

To fulfill its commitments, KubeSphere provides a user-friendly UI wizard and rich enterprise-grade features. KubeSphere enables features such as observability, microservices governance, multi-cluster and multi-tenant management, DevOps, full lifecycle management for applications, and cloud-edge collaboration. **This way, KubeSphere can free you from complex and varied technical details involved in the underlying architecture of Kubernetes, helping you use Kubernetes with ease.**

The achievement of 10,000 GitHub stars has tremendous implications for KubeSphere, which marks that KubeSphere has transformed into the **only** world-influential open source container platform initiated by a Chinese company, despite all difficulties and hazards during the whole process.

Many thanks to all KubeSphere users and contributors. Let’s join us in looking back at what KubeSphere has achieved all the way along:

+ Released several major versions and added rich features in the latest major versions 3.1 and 3.2. For more information, see [KubeSphere 3.2.0 GA: Bringing AI-oriented GPU Scheduling and Flexible Gateway](https://kubesphere.io/news/kubesphere-3.2.0-ga-announcement/).
+ Launched services in major global public cloud application markets, such as AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, and QingCloud. KubeSphere is also integrated with various container engines, such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), DigitalOcean Kubernetes, and QingCloud Kubernetes Engine (QKE).
+ Developed **Fluentbit Operator** to manage Fluent Bit in cloud native architectures and contributed it to the Fluent community. With Fluentd integrated, Fluentbit Operator was renamed **Fluent Operator** (GitHub URL: https://github.com/fluent/fluent-operator).
+ Initiated the PorterLB project in the KubeSphere community to resolve the issue that might occur on exposing the LoadBalancer service in Kubernetes clusters outside public clouds. This project was renamed [OpenELB](https://github.com/kubesphere/openelb/). **On November 10, 2021**, this project was managed as a sandbox project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) umbrella.
+ Launched the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) project OpenFunction in the KubeSphere community in December 2020. **On April 27, 2022**, this project was managed as a sandbox project under the CNCF umbrella.
+ Provided services for **tens of thousands of enterprises** in production environments. The enterprise users are across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, medical care, education, and manufacturing.
+ Built the KubeSphere community widely welcomed by developers. The number of followers in the WeChat community of KubeSphere has exceeded **5,000** and the number of Slack members has reached nearly **2,000**. 

These achievements wouldn’t have happened without all of you, so we want to thank everyone of you who has contributed to KubeSphere. No matter in what forms you contribute to KubeSphere, from submitting code, creating issues, improving documentation, to sharing your experience with KubeSphere and cloud native implementation, you are playing a pivotal role in the advancement of KubeSphere. 

Let’s join us as we celebrate our bright moments!
