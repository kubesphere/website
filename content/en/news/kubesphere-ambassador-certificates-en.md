To date, dozens of community members have been recognized as KubeSphere Ambassadors. They have helped popularize and expand the influence of 

KubeSphere in their own ways, and most of them are continuously active and making their contributions.

For instance, Min Yin (Hangzhou station head of the KubeSphere Community User Committee) and Haili Zhang (Shanghai station head) are active community contributors. They made their dedication to the development of KubeSphere by writing articles and organizing exchange activities, etc.

As a rapidly growing open-source community, KubeSphere welcomes more evangelists and contributors to build a better community in the new year, and every year to come. Join us!
