“In fact, it is Radore that came to us first.” Ray further explained the partnership in detail. “They have done a lot of research and selected KubeSphere in the end. They hope to build a local KubeSphere community and further promote it. They even asked us to authorize them to be the gateway for KubeSphere to Europe and Africa so that more people can share the benefits of KubeSphere.”

Radore has created its Radore Cloud Datacenter (RCD) infrastructure. It is managed through a web interface where customers can see every detail. As KubeSphere has been successfully tested on the platform, it will serve as an outstanding solution for Turkish users in terms of application deployment, operation and more.

Under the partnership, Radore will first provide localizations for KubeSphere web console, followed by local websites, related documentation and so on. It will also hold both online and offline activities for KubeSphere users in Turkey, boosting the growth of local community in the country.

“I firmly believe that we will usher in an era of hybrid cloud featuring numerous innovative cloud native applications.” Ray added. “However, it also means a matter of ecosystem competition. For KubeSphere, we are pleased and honored to engage Radore on our journey to the future.”
