        - content: Hua Xia Bank started operation in Beijing in October 1992 when China ushered in the program of reform and opening up led by Chief Architect Deng Xiaoping. The Bank became a nationwide joint-stock commercial bank after restructuring in March 1995. In September 2003, Hua Xia Bank went public as the fifth of Chinese banks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (Stock Ticker:600015).

        - content: As a financial institution, Hua Xia Bank is in the progress of FinTech transformation to provide technology leading financial services to customers.
        - content: In their bank, there are over 40 first-tier branches nationwide. Each of them has its local banking businesses with various requirements required to be delivered fast. Besides, there are many applications like fund supervision, ETC, payment systems in each branch written in different languages such as C/C++, Java, and Python, using traditional monolithic architecture, and deployed on VMs. Moreover, they have a large custom snowflake ecosystem in their development, where each tool needs its configuration and deployment.

    - title: 'Adopt KubeSphere as the Platform Solution'
      contentList:
        - content: As Hua Xia Bank chooses to migrate its applications to Kubernetes, we introduce KubeSphere, a developer-friendly distributed operating system, to enhance the Kubernetes platform abilities. With the unified portal to connect DevOps, microservices management, and Kubernetes platform in KubeSphere, it helps us to adopt a cloud-native stack more easily. By using Istio service mesh, we can easily implement the grayscale release. KubeSphere brings the simplified DevOps workflow to us, and its built-in roles are designed for developers and operators.
        - content: Additionally, observability is critical in daily development and operations. KubeSphere helps us locate the issues and bottlenecks between different microservices by providing centralized log search and monitoring features.

    - title: 'Kubernetes is tailored for microservices architecture'
      contentList:
        - content: As the first team in our bank to adopt Kubernetes since 2019, we are committed to leading FinTech transformation to make technologies boosting financial business innovations. Fortunately, several experimental projects prove that Kubernetes is tailored for microservices architecture, and it is a great time-saver for multiple branches in our bank.
        - content: 'When branch developers see how quickly containers could be spun up compared to the VMs process, all branches try to run their applications in containers and ship them in Kubernetes. With Kubernetes and KubeSphere platform, the release process goes from several hours to several minutes, and time to market has also been improved significantly.'

    - title: 'Cloud-Native is a Great Way to Accelerate the FinTech Transformation'
      contentList:
        - content: When it comes to the benefits to the ecosystem, we have demonstrated cloud-native is a great way to accelerate the FinTech transformation. We, as a pioneer in our bank, give some best practices to other projects. Today, developers can quickly deploy, ship code, and release their applications written in different languages and frameworks smoothly. Kubernetes consistently provides the tools we need in the cloud-native ecosystem.

    - title: About KubeSphere
      contentList:
        - content: KubeSphere unifies many cloud-native technologies and tools, including Docker, Istio mesh, DevOps, monitoring, and logging. We have demonstrated a best practice of using Kubernetes and KubeSphere with multiple branches in our bank.
        - content: As for the banking industry, most applications must be fault-tolerant, highly available, and reliable, we have proved that even running these applications on Kubernetes can achieve these stringent requirements simultaneously. We hope our user case study will help to promote the wide adoption of Kubernetes in the banking industry.
