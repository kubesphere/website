  title: KubeSphere Service Mesh provides a simpler distribution of Istio with consolidated UX.
  content: If you’re running and scaling microservices on Kubernetes, it’s time to adopt the Istio-based service mesh for your distributed system. We design a unified UI to integrate and manage tools including Istio, Envoy and Jaeger.

      summary:
      contentList:
        - content: <span>Canary release</span> provides canary rollouts and staged rollouts with percentage-based traffic splits
        - content: <span>Blue-green deployment</span> allows the new version of an application to be deployed in a separate environment and tested for functionality and performance
        - content: <span>Traffic mirroring</span> is a powerful, risk-free method of testing your app versions as it sends a copy of live traffic to a mirrored Service
        - content: <span>Circuit breakers</span> allow users to set limits for calls to individual hosts within a Service

    - title: Visualization
      image: /images/service-mesh/visualization.png
      summary: Observability is extremely useful in understanding cloud-native microservice interconnections. KubeSphere has the ability to visualize the connections between microservices and the topology of how they interconnect.

    - title: Distributed Tracing
      image: /images/service-mesh/distributed-tracing.png
      summary: Based on Jaeger, KubeSphere enables users to track how each Service interacts with each other. It brings a deeper understanding about request latency, bottlenecks, serialization and parallelism via visualization.
