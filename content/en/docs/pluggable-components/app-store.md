## What is KubeSphere App Store

As an open-source and app-centric container platform, KubeSphere provides users with a Helm-based app store for application lifecycle management on the back of [OpenPitrix](https://github.com/openpitrix/openpitrix), an open-source web-based system to package, deploy and manage different types of apps. The KubeSphere App Store allows ISVs, developers and users to upload, test, deploy and release apps with just several clicks in a one-stop shop.

Internally, the KubeSphere App Store can serve as a place for different teams to share data, middleware, and office applications. Externally, it is conducive to setting industry standards of building and delivery. By default, there are 15 built-in apps in the App Store. After you enable this feature, you can add more apps with app templates.

For more information, see [App Store](../../application-store/).

## Enable the App Store before Installation

### Installing on Linux

When you implement multi-node installation of KubeSphere on Linux, you need to create a configuration file, which lists all KubeSphere components.

1. In the tutorial of [Installing KubeSphere on Linux](../../installing-on-linux/introduction/multioverview/), you create a default file `config-sample.yaml`. Modify the file by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    vi config-sample.yaml
    ```

    {{< notice note >}}
If you adopt [All-in-One Installation](../../quick-start/all-in-one-on-linux/), you do not need to create a `config-sample.yaml` file as you can create a cluster directly. Generally, the all-in-one mode is for users who are new to KubeSphere and look to get familiar with the system. If you want to enable the App Store in this mode (e.g. for testing purposes), refer to [the following section](#enable-app-store-after-installation) to see how the App Store can be installed after installation.
    {{</ notice >}}

2. In this file, navigate to `openpitrix` and change `false` to `true` for `enabled`. Save the file after you finish.

    ```yaml
    openpitrix:
        enabled: true # Change "false" to "true"
    ```

3. Create a cluster using the configuration file:

    ```bash
    ./kk create cluster -f config-sample.yaml
    ```

### **Installing on Kubernetes**

The process of installing KubeSphere on Kubernetes is same as stated in the tutorial of [Installing KubeSphere on Kubernetes](../../installing-on-kubernetes/introduction/overview/) except the optional component App Store needs to be enabled first in the [cluster-configuration.yaml](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.0.0/cluster-configuration.yaml) file.

1. Download the file [cluster-configuration.yaml](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.0.0/cluster-configuration.yaml) and edit it.

    ```bash
    vi cluster-configuration.yaml
    ```

2. In this local `cluster-configuration.yaml` file, navigate to `openpitrix` and enable the App Store by changing `false` to `true` for `enabled`. Save the file after you finish.

    ```yaml
    openpitrix:
        enabled: true # Change "false" to "true"
    ```

3. Execute the following commands to start installation:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.0.0/kubesphere-installer.yaml

    kubectl apply -f cluster-configuration.yaml
    ```

## Enable the App Store after Installation

1. Log in to the console as `admin`. Click **Platform** in the top-left corner and select **Cluster Management**.
   
   ![clusters-management](/images/docs/enable-pluggable-components/kubesphere-app-store/clusters-management.png)

2. Click **CRDs** and enter `clusterconfiguration` in the search bar. Click the result to view its detail page.

    {{< notice info >}}

A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) allows users to create a new type of resources without adding another API server. They can use these resources like any other native Kubernetes objects.

{{</ notice >}}

3. In **Resource List**, click the three dots on the right of `ks-installer` and select **Edit YAML**.

    ![edit-yaml](/images/docs/enable-pluggable-components/kubesphere-app-store/edit-yaml.png)

4. In this yaml file, navigate to `openpitrix` and change `false` to `true` for `enabled`. After you finish, click **Update** in the bottom-right corner to save the configuration.

    ```yaml
    openpitrix:
        enabled: true # Change "false" to "true"
    ```

5. You can use the web kubectl to check the installation process by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kubesphere-system $(kubectl get pod -n kubesphere-system -l app=ks-install -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -f
    ```

    {{< notice tip >}}
    

You can find the web kubectl tool by clicking the hammer icon in the bottom-right corner of the console.

## Verify the Installation of the Component

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "Verify the component on the dashboard" >}}

Go to **Components** and check the status of **OpenPitrix**. You may see an image as follows:

![openpitrix](/images/docs/enable-pluggable-components/kubesphere-app-store/openpitrix.png)

{{</ tab >}}

{{< tab "Verify the component through kubectl" >}}

Execute the following command to check the status of Pods:

```bash
kubectl get pod -n openpitrix-system
```

The output may look as follows if the component runs successfully:

```bash
NAME                                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
hyperpitrix-generate-kubeconfig-pznht               0/2     Completed   0          1h6m
hyperpitrix-release-app-job-hzdjf                   0/1     Completed   0          1h6m
openpitrix-hyperpitrix-deployment-fb76645f4-crvmm   1/1     Running     0          1h6m
```

{{</ tab >}}

## Use the App Store in a Multi-cluster Architecture

[In a multi-cluster architecture](../../multicluster-management/introduction/kubefed-in-kubesphere/), you have one Host Cluster (H Cluster) managing all Member Clusters (M Clusters). Different from other components in KubeSphere, the App Store serves as a global application pool for all clusters, including H Cluster and M Clusters. You only need to enable the App Store on the H Cluster and you can use functions related to the App Store on M Clusters directly (no matter whether the App Store is enabled on M Clusters or not), such as [app templates](../../project-user-guide/application/app-template/) and [app repositories](../../workspace-administration/app-repository/import-helm-repository/).

However, if you only enable the App Store on M Clusters without enabling it on the H Cluster, you will not be able to use the App Store on any cluster in the multi-cluster architecture.
