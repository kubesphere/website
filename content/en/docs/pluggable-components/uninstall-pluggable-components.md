After you [enable the pluggable components of KubeSphere](../../pluggable-components/), you can also uninstall them by performing the following steps. Please back up any necessary data before you uninstall these components.

{{< notice note >}}

The methods of uninstalling certain pluggable components on KubeSphere 3.3.0 are different from the methods on KubeSphere v3.3.0. For more information about the uninstallation methods on KubeSphere v3.3.0, see [Uninstall Pluggable Components from KubeSphere](https://v3-0.docs.kubesphere.io/docs/faq/installation/uninstall-pluggable-components/).

{{</ notice >}}

## Prerequisites

You have to change the value of the field `enabled` from `true` to `false` in `ks-installer` of the CRD `ClusterConfiguration` before you uninstall any pluggable components except Service Topology and Pod IP Pools. 

Use either of the following methods to change the value of the field `enabled`:

- Run the following command to edit `ks-installer`:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n kubesphere-system edit clusterconfiguration ks-installer
  ```

- Log in to the KubeSphere web console as `admin`, click **Platform** in the upper-left corner and select **Cluster Management**, and then go to **CRDs** to search for `ClusterConfiguration`. For more information, see [Enable Pluggable Components](../../../pluggable-components/).

{{< notice note >}}

After the value is changed, you need to wait until the updating process is complete before you continue with any further operations.

## Uninstall KubeSphere DevOps

1. To uninstall DevOps:

   ```bash
   helm uninstall -n kubesphere-devops-system devops
   kubectl patch -n kubesphere-system cc ks-installer --type=json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/status/devops"}]'
   kubectl patch -n kubesphere-system cc ks-installer --type=json -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/devops/enabled", "value": false}]'
   ```
2. To delete DevOps resources:

   ```bash
   # Remove all resources related with DevOps
   for devops_crd in $(kubectl get crd -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}' | grep "devops.kubesphere.io"); do
       for ns in $(kubectl get ns -ojsonpath='{.items..metadata.name}'); do
           for devops_res in $(kubectl get $devops_crd -n $ns -oname); do
               kubectl patch $devops_res -n $ns -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
           done
       done
   done
   # Remove all DevOps CRDs
   kubectl get crd -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}' | grep "devops.kubesphere.io" | xargs -I crd_name kubectl delete crd crd_name
   # Remove DevOps namespace
   kubectl delete namespace kubesphere-devops-system
   ```


## Uninstall KubeSphere Logging

1. Change the value of `logging.enabled` from `true` to `false` in `ks-installer` of the CRD `ClusterConfiguration`.

2. To disable only log collection:

   kubectl delete crd inputs.logging.kubesphere.io
   kubectl delete crd outputs.logging.kubesphere.io
   kubectl delete crd parsers.logging.kubesphere.io
   kubectl delete deployments.apps -n kubesphere-logging-system fluentbit-operator
   helm uninstall elasticsearch-logging --namespace kubesphere-logging-system
   ```
