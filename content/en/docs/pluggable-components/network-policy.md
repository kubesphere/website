Starting from v3.0.0, users can configure network policies of native Kubernetes in KubeSphere. Network Policies are an application-centric construct, enabling you to specify how a Pod is allowed to communicate with various network entities over the network. With network policies, users can achieve network isolation within the same cluster, which means firewalls can be set up between certain instances (Pods).

{{< notice note >}}

- Please make sure that the CNI network plugin used by the cluster supports Network Policies before you enable the feature. There are a number of CNI network plugins that support Network Policies, including Calico, Cilium, Kube-router, Romana and Weave Net.
- It is recommended that you use [Calico](https://www.projectcalico.org/) as the CNI plugin before you enable Network Policies.

## Enable the Network Policy before Installation

### Installing on Linux

When you implement multi-node installation of KubeSphere on Linux, you need to create a configuration file, which lists all KubeSphere components.

1. In the tutorial of [Installing KubeSphere on Linux](../../installing-on-linux/introduction/multioverview/), you create a default file `config-sample.yaml`. Modify the file by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    vi config-sample.yaml
    ```

    {{< notice note >}}
If you adopt [All-in-One Installation](../../quick-start/all-in-one-on-linux/), you do not need to create a `config-sample.yaml` file as you can create a cluster directly. Generally, the all-in-one mode is for users who are new to KubeSphere and look to get familiar with the system. If you want to enable the Network Policy in this mode (for example, for testing purposes), refer to [the following section](#enable-network-policy-after-installation) to see how the Network Policy can be installed after installation.
    {{</ notice >}}

2. In this file, navigate to `network.networkpolicy` and change `false` to `true` for `enabled`. Save the file after you finish.

    ```yaml
    network:
      networkpolicy:
        enabled: true # Change "false" to "true".
    ```

3. Create a cluster using the configuration file:

    ```bash
    ./kk create cluster -f config-sample.yaml
    ```

### Installing on Kubernetes

As you [install KubeSphere on Kubernetes](../../installing-on-kubernetes/introduction/overview/), you can enable the Network Policy first in the [cluster-configuration.yaml](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.1.0/cluster-configuration.yaml) file.

1. Download the file [cluster-configuration.yaml](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.1.0/cluster-configuration.yaml) and edit it.

    ```bash
    vi cluster-configuration.yaml
    ```

2. In this local `cluster-configuration.yaml` file, navigate to `network.networkpolicy` and enable it by changing `false` to `true` for `enabled`. Save the file after you finish.

    ```yaml
    network:
      networkpolicy:
        enabled: true # Change "false" to "true".
    ```

3. Execute the following commands to start installation:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.1.0/kubesphere-installer.yaml
    
    kubectl apply -f cluster-configuration.yaml
    ```

## Enable the Network Policy after Installation

1. Log in to the console as `admin`. Click **Platform** in the top-left corner and select **Cluster Management**.
   
2. Click **CRDs** and enter `clusterconfiguration` in the search bar. Click the result to view its detail page.

    {{< notice info >}}
A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) allows users to create a new type of resources without adding another API server. They can use these resources like any other native Kubernetes objects.
    {{</ notice >}}

3. In **Resource List**, click <img src="/images/docs/enable-pluggable-components/network-policies/three-dots.png" height="20px"> on the right of `ks-installer` and select **Edit YAML**.

4. In this YAML file, navigate to `network.networkpolicy` and change `false` to `true` for `enabled`. After you finish, click **Update** in the bottom-right corner to save the configuration.

    ```yaml
    network:
      networkpolicy:
        enabled: true # Change "false" to "true".
    ```

5. You can use the web kubectl to check the installation process by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kubesphere-system $(kubectl get pod -n kubesphere-system -l app=ks-install -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -f
    ```

    {{< notice note >}}

You can find the web kubectl tool by clicking <img src="/images/docs/enable-pluggable-components/network-policies/hammer.png" height="20px"> in the bottom-right corner of the console.

## Verify the Installation of the Component

If you can see **Network Policies** in **Network** as the image below, it means the installation succeeds as this part won't display until you install the component.
