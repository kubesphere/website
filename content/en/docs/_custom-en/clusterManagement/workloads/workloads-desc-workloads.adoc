This section explains how to manage workloads.

In KubeSphere, applications run in pods. To ensure business continuity in case of pod failures, it is common to create multiple replicas of a pod for an application. Workloads are responsible for managing replicas of pods and provide the following key functionalities:

* Automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on user-defined conditions.
* Automatically update pods based on user-specified update strategies.
* Roll back pods to previous versions.

KubeSphere supports the following types of workloads:

* Deployment: Used to manage stateless applications. Multiple replicas managed by a Deployment share a common volume. When a pod replica is recreated, the new and old replicas have different names.
* StatefulSet: Used to manage stateful applications. Multiple replicas managed by a StatefulSet can use independent volumes. Each pod replica has a fixed index in its name, and when a pod replica is recreated, the new and old replicas have the same name.
* DaemonSet: Used to manage daemon processes. DaemonSet ensures that one pod replica runs on all or specific nodes. When a new node is added to the cluster, if the new node meets the scheduling rules, DaemonSet will automatically create a pod replica on the new node.
