|Cluster
|A cluster is a larger computer service system composed of a group of independent computers or servers.

|Node
|A node is each machine that makes up a cluster, which can be either a virtual machine or a physical machine. Each node can operate and process tasks independently.

|Workspace
|A workspace is the basic logical unit for managing projects and members, serving as the foundation of the KubeSphere multi-tenant system.

|Workspace Member
|A user invited to work in a workspace with specific permissions.

|Project
|A project in KubeSphere corresponds to a namespace in Kubernetes.

|Multi-cluster Project
|A project where workloads are deployed across multiple clusters.

|Pod
|A Pod is the smallest manageable unit of an application in Kubernetes, functioning as the logical host for the application. Each Pod contains one or more containers that share resources such as network and storage. Typically, a Pod is used to run a single instance of a given application.

|Container
|A container is a portable, executable lightweight image used to encapsulate an application and its dependencies in an independent runtime environment.

|Image
|An image is a static template for a container, containing the application's code, runtime environment, and dependencies, and is used to create container instances.

|An open-source application container engine used to create, deploy, and manage containers.

|Docker Hub
|A container image repository.

|KubeKey
|A new installation tool that offers flexible installation options, allowing users to install Kubernetes alone or Kubernetes and KubeSphere together. KubeKey also supports various installation methods, such as All-in-One, multi-node, and offline installation. Users only need to prepare the configuration file and execute the relevant commands.

// |ks-installer
// |An installation package for deploying KubeSphere on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

|kube-proxy
|kube-proxy is a network proxy running on each node in the cluster.

|Kubectl
|kubectl is the command-line tool for Kubernetes, used to communicate with the control plane of a cluster. It supports operations such as cluster management, application deployment, and resource status queries.

|Job
|A Job is a deterministic or batch task that needs to be completed, used to manage Pods that run once or periodically. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/[Job].

|CronJob
|A CronJob is a batch task that needs to run at a specific time or at specified intervals. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/[CronJob].

|Service

|LoadBalancer
|Exposes a service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.

|Ingress
|Ingress is used to aggregate services within the cluster and provide external access. Each Ingress contains mapping rules from domain names and their subpaths to different services. In KubeSphere, Ingress corresponds to Kubernetes Ingress.
|===

== Storage

[%header,cols="1a,4a"]
|===
|Term
|Description

|A basic resource object used to provide storage for containers.

|Storage Class
|Defines the types of storage volumes available for containers.

|Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
|A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a user's declaration of storage requirements, which is a namespaced resource. The declaration can specify storage size, access modes, and more. The system binds or creates a Persistent Volume (PV) based on the Persistent Volume Claim.

|Persistent Volume (PV)
|A storage area created in the backend storage system based on the parameters in the PVC, available for containers. It is a general-purpose, pluggable, and persistent resource not bound by the lifecycle of a single Pod.

|Volume Snapshot Class
|Defines a class of volume snapshots that can save snapshot data.

|Volume Snapshot
|A complete copy or image of volume data at a specific point in time. Data can be fully restored to the snapshot point using the snapshot.

== DevOps

[%header,cols="1a,4a"]
|===
|Term
|Description

|DevOps Project
|DevOps Project is used to create and manage pipelines, credentials, and CI/CD-related resources.

|SCM (Source Control Management)
|Source control management, such as GitHub and GitLab.

|In-SCM
|Building Jenkinsfile-based pipelines through SCM tools.

|Out-of-SCM
|Building pipelines through a graphical editing panel without writing Jenkinsfile.

|CI Node
|A dedicated node for pipelines, S2I, and B2I tasks. Applications often need to pull multiple dependencies during the build process, which can lead to issues such as long pull times, network instability, and build failures. To ensure pipeline stability and speed up builds (through caching), you can configure one or a group of CI nodes dedicated to CI/CD pipelines and S2I/B2I tasks.

|B2I (Binary-to-Image)
|B2I is a set of tools and workflows for building reproducible container images from binary executables (e.g., Jar and War). Developers and operations teams can quickly package artifacts or binary packages into Docker images and publish them to image repositories like DockerHub or Harbor.

|S2I (Source-to-Image)
|S2I is a set of tools and workflows for building reproducible container images from source code. By injecting source code into container images, it automatically packages the compiled code into an image. KubeSphere supports S2I for building images and creating services to generate images from source code, push them to repositories, and deploy them to Kubernetes.
