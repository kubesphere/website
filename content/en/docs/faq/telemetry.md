Telemetry collects aggregate information about the size of KubeSphere clusters installed, KubeSphere and Kubernetes versions, components enabled, cluster running time, error logs, etc. KubeSphere promises that the information is only used by the KubeSphere community to improve products and will not be shared with any third parties.

## What Information Is Collected

- External network IP
- Download date
- Kubernetes version
- KubeSphere version
- Kubernetes cluster size
- The type of the operating system
- Installer error logs
- Components enabled
- The running time of Kubernetes clusters
- The running time of KubeSphere clusters
- Cluster ID
- Machine ID

## Disable Telemetry

Telemetry is enabled by default when you install KubeSphere, while you also have the option to disable it either before or after the installation.

### Disable Telemetry before Installation

When you install KubeSphere on existing Kubernetes clusters, you need to download the file [cluster-configuration.yaml](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.0.0/cluster-configuration.yaml) for cluster setting. If you want to disable Telemetry, do not use `kubectl apply -f` directly for this file.

{{< notice note >}} 

If you install KubeSphere on Linux, see [Disable Telemetry after Installation](../telemetry/#disable-telemetry-after-installation) directly.

{{</ notice >}} 

1. In the tutorial of [Installing KubeSphere on Kubernetes](../../installing-on-kubernetes/introduction/overview/), you execute `kubectl apply -f` first for the file [kubesphere-installer.yaml](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.0.0/kubesphere-installer.yaml). After that, create a local file `cluster-configuration.yaml` through the following command:

```bash
vi cluster-configuration.yaml
```

2. Copy all the content in the file [cluster-configuration.yaml](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.0.0/cluster-configuration.yaml) and paste it to the local file just created.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the file and add the value `telemetry_enabled: false` as follows:

```yaml
  openpitrix:
    enabled: false
  servicemesh:
    enabled: false
  telemetry_enabled: false # Add this line here to disable Telemetry.
```

4. Save the file after you finish and execute the following command to start installation.

```bash
kubectl apply -f cluster-configuration.yaml
```

### Disable Telemetry after Installation

1. Log in the console as `admin` and click **Platform** in the top left corner.
2. Select **Clusters Management** and navigate to **CRDs**.

{{< notice note >}}

If you have enabled [the multi-cluster feature](../../multicluster-management/), you need to select a cluster first.

3. Input `clusterconfiguration` in the search bar and click the result to go to its detail page.

4. Click the three dots on the right of `ks-installer` and select **Edit YAML**.

5. Scroll down to the bottom of the file and add the value `telemetry_enabled: false`. When you finish, click **Update**.

{{< notice note >}}

If you want to enable Telemetry again, you can update `ks-installer` by deleting the value  `telemetry_enabled: false` or changing it to  `telemetry_enabled: true`.
