This document describes the process to gracefully shut down your cluster. You might need to temporarily shut down your cluster for maintenance reasons.

{{< notice warning >}}
Shutting down cluster is very dangerous, you must to understand what are you doing and make an etcd backup before proceeding.
Usually we recommend one by one maintenance nodes instead of restarting cluster.
{{</ notice >}}

### Prerequisites
Take an [etcd buckup](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/recovery.md#snapshotting-the-keyspace) prior to shutting down the cluster.

### Shutting Down the Cluster
{{< notice warning >}}
You must to take an etcd backup before proceeding for your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues when restarting the cluster.
{{</ notice >}}

{{< notice tip >}}
Use this method can shut down the cluster gracefully ,but there is still the possibility of data corruption.
{{</ notice >}}

### Step 1: Get the List of Nodes.
```bash
nodes=$(kubectl get nodes -o name)
```
### Step 2: Shut Down all Nodes
```bash
for node in ${nodes[@]}
do
    echo "==== Shut down $node ===="
    ssh $node sudo shutdown -h 1
done
```
Then you can shut down other cluster dependencies, such as external storage.

## Restart the Cluster Gracefully
This is about restarting the cluster gracefully after shutting down cluster gracefully.

### Prerequisites
You had shutdown your cluster gracefully.

{{< notice tip >}}
Usually, the cluster can be used after restarting, but the cluster may be unavailable due to unexpected conditions, for example:
- The Etcd Data Corruption During Shutdown.
- Node Status is Failure.
- Network Exception.
{{</ notice >}}

### Step 1: Ensure all Cluster Dependencies are Deady, such as External Storage.
### Step 2: Power on cluster machines.
Wait for the cluster make ready, it takes about 10 minutes.
### Step 3: Check all Master Nodes Status,Ensure They are Ready.
```bash
kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
```

### Step 4: Check all Woker Nodes Status.
```bash
kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
```

If your cluster fails to restart, maybe you shuold [restore etcd cluster](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/recovery.md#restoring-a-cluster).
