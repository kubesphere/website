You can use Elasticsearch, Kafka and Fluentd as log receivers in KubeSphere. This tutorial demonstrates:

- How to deploy Fluentd as a Deployment and create the corresponding Service and ConfigMap.
- How to add Fluentd as a log receiver to receive logs sent from Fluent Bit and then output to stdout.
- How to verify if Fluentd receives logs successfully.

## Prerequisites

- You need an account granted a role including the authorization of **Clusters Management**. For example, you can log in to the console as `admin` directly or create a new role with the authorization and assign it to an account.

- Before adding a log receiver, you need to enable any of the `logging`, `events` or `auditing` components. For more information, see [Enable Pluggable Components](../../../../pluggable-components/). `logging` is enabled as an example in this tutorial.

## Step 1: Deploy Fluentd as a Deployment

Usually, Fluentd is deployed as a DaemonSet in Kubernetes to collect container logs on each node. KubeSphere chooses Fluent Bit because of its low memory footprint. Besides, Fluentd features numerous output plugins. Hence, KubeSphere chooses to deploy Fluentd as a Deployment to forward logs it receives from Fluent Bit to more destinations such as S3, MongoDB, Cassandra, MySQL, syslog and Splunk.

Run the following commands:

{{< notice note >}}

- The following commands create the Fluentd Deployment, Service and ConfigMap in the `default` namespace and add a filter to the Fluentd ConfigMap to exclude logs from the `default` namespace to avoid Fluent Bit and Fluentd loop log collections.
- Change the namespace if you want to deploy Fluentd into a different namespace.

{{</ notice >}}

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fluentd-config
  namespace: default
data:
  fluent.conf: |-
    # Receive logs sent from Fluent Bit on port 24224
    <source>
      @type forward
      port 24224
    </source>

    # Because this will send logs Fluentd received to stdout,
    # to avoid Fluent Bit and Fluentd loop logs collection,
    # add a filter here to avoid sending logs from the default namespace to stdout again
    <filter **>
      @type grep
      <exclude>
        key $.kubernetes.namespace_name
        pattern /^default$/
      </exclude>
    </filter>

    # Send received logs to stdout for demo/test purpose only
    # Various output plugins are supported to output logs to S3, MongoDB, Cassandra, MySQL, syslog, Splunk, etc.
    <match **>
      @type stdout
    </match>

## Step 2: Add Fluentd as a Log Receiver (i.e. Collector)

1. Log in to KubeSphere as `admin`. Click **Platform** in the top left corner and select **Clusters Management**.
2. If you have enabled the [multi-cluster feature](../../../../multicluster-management/), you can select a specific cluster. If you have not enabled the feature, refer to the next step directly.
3. On the **Cluster Management** page, go to **Log Collections** in **Cluster Settings**.

4. Click **Add Log Collector** and choose **Fluentd**.

5. Provide the Fluentd service address and port as below:

   ![add-fluentd](/images/docs/cluster-administration/cluster-settings/log-collections/add-fluentd-as-receiver/add-fluentd.png)

6. Fluentd will appear in the receiver list on the **Log Collections** page, the status of which is **Collecting**.

## Step 3: Verify Fluentd is Receiving Logs Sent from Fluent Bit

1. Click **Application Workloads** on the **Cluster Management** page.

2. Select **Workloads** and then select the `default` project from the drop-down list in the **Deployments** tab.

3. Click the **fluentd** item and then select the **fluentd-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx** Pod.

4. Click the **fluentd** container.

5. On the **fluentd** container page, select the **Container Logs** tab.

6. You can see logs begin to scroll up continuously.
