You can use Elasticsearch, Kafka and Fluentd as log receivers in KubeSphere. This tutorial demonstrates how to add an Elasticsearch receiver.

## Prerequisites

- You need an account granted a role including the permission of **Cluster Management**. For example, you can log in to the console as `admin` directly or create a new role with the permission and assign it to an account.

- Before adding a log receiver, you need to enable any of the `logging`, `events` or `auditing` components. For more information, see [Enable Pluggable Components](../../../../pluggable-components/). `logging` is enabled as an example in this tutorial.

## Add Elasticsearch as a Receiver

1. Log in to KubeSphere as `admin`. Click **Platform** in the top-left corner and select **Cluster Management**.

If you have enabled the [multi-cluster feature](../../../../multicluster-management/), you can select a specific cluster.

2. On the **Cluster Management** page, go to **Log Collection** in **Cluster Settings**.

3. Click **Add Log Receiver** and choose **Elasticsearch**.

4. Provide the Elasticsearch service address and port as below:

5. Elasticsearch will appear in the receiver list on the **Log Collection** page, the status of which is **Collecting**.

6. To verify whether Elasticsearch is receiving logs sent from Fluent Bit, click **Log Search** in the **Toolbox** in the bottom-right corner and search logs on the console. For more information, read [Log Query](../../../../toolbox/log-query/).
