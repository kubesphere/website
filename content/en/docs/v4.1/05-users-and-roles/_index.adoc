KubeSphere is a container management platform that supports multi-tenancy. Similar to Kubernetes, it controls user permissions through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to achieve logical resource isolation.

Resources in KubeSphere are divided into four levels: Platform, Workspace, Cluster, and Project. All resources belong to these four levels, and access to resources can be controlled through roles at each level. Each level comes with multiple built-in roles by default, and you can also create custom roles with specific permissions.

Workspace serves as the smallest tenant unit, providing resource isolation capabilities across clusters. Members within a Workspace can create projects in authorized clusters and collaborate on projects by inviting users.

This section explains how to manage access permissions on the KubeSphere platform, including user and platform role management.
