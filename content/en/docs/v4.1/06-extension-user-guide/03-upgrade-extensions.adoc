This section explains how to upgrade extensions.

Before upgrading the extensions, make sure to update the extension repository to fetch the latest versions. You can update the ks-core extension repository using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
bash -c '#!/bin/bash
set -e          # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -o pipefail # Fail the entire pipeline if any command fails

# If CHART_VERSION is not set via environment variable, fetch it from the installed release
if [ -z "$CHART_VERSION" ]; then
  CHART_VERSION=$(helm -n kubesphere-system get metadata ks-core -o json | jq -r '.version')

  if [[ -z "$CHART_VERSION" || "$CHART_VERSION" == "null" ]]; then
    echo "❌ Failed to retrieve the Chart version of ks-core. Aborting."
    exit 1
  fi
fi

# Construct the Chart URL
CHART_URL="https://charts.kubesphere.io/main/ks-core-$CHART_VERSION.tgz"

# If EXTENSION_REPOSITORY_VERSION is not set via environment variable, fetch it from GitHub
if [ -z "$EXTENSION_REPOSITORY_VERSION" ]; then
  EXTENSION_REPOSITORY_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubesphere-extensions/ks-extensions/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name')

  if [[ -z "$EXTENSION_REPOSITORY_VERSION" || "$EXTENSION_REPOSITORY_VERSION" == "null" ]]; then
    echo "❌ Failed to retrieve the latest version of ks-extensions. Aborting."
    echo "You can manually visit the GitHub releases page to find the latest version: https://github.com/kubesphere-extensions/ks-extensions/releases"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

# Upgrade ks-core using the retrieved or provided versions
echo "✅ Preparing to upgrade ks-core to version $CHART_VERSION using extension repository version $EXTENSION_REPOSITORY_VERSION"
helm -n kubesphere-system upgrade ks-core "$CHART_URL" \
  --set ksExtensionRepository.image.tag="$EXTENSION_REPOSITORY_VERSION" \
  --wait --debug'
