This section explains how to manage storage resources.

KubeSphere supports the management of the following storage resources:

* Storage Class: Defines a class of Persistent Volume Claims available for containers.

* Persistent Volume Claim: Defines the storage space requirements for a Persistent Volume.

* Persistent Volume: Represents a storage area in the backend storage system. The system creates a storage area available for containers in the backend storage system based on the parameters in the Persistent Volume Claim. Each storage area corresponds to a Persistent Volume in the KubeSphere platform.
