== Kubernetes Version Requirements

KubeSphere v4.1.3 has been tested and supports Kubernetes versions from v1.21 to v1.30, versions that have not been tested are not guaranteed to be compatible.

Different extensions may support different versions of Kubernetes and KubeSphere. You can check the compatibility details on the respective extension pages. Please choose the appropriate version of each component based on your actual environment.

For information about the version compatibility of KubeSphere v3.x, please refer to the deployment documentation of the corresponding historical versions.

== Storage Requirements

* A default storage class must be available in the cluster.
+
--
Storage classes define a class of storage volumes that containers can use. If you did not set up an external persistent storage system during the installation of {ks_product-en}, {ks_product-en} will use the local storage system of the cluster nodes as the persistent storage system and automatically create the corresponding **local** storage class. If you are using an external persistent storage system, you need to install a storage plugin for the KubeSphere cluster and create storage classes to define the classes of storage volumes that can be used. For information on how to install storage plugins, please contact your storage system provider. For information on how to install the storage plugin, contact your storage system provider or refer to link:../04-configure-external-persistent-storage[Configure External Persistent Storage].
--

* The various components of {ks_product-en} only require the storage system to support creating and deleting persistent volume claims (PVCs) and do not rely on advanced capabilities such as expansion, cloning, and snapshots.

== Dependency Requirements

== Container Runtime Requirements

[%header,cols="4a,4a"]
|===
|Supported Container Runtimes |Version

|Docker
|20.10.0+

|containerd
|Latest version

|CRI-O (Experimental, not fully tested)
|Latest version

|iSula (Experimental, not fully tested)
|Latest version
|===

== Network Requirements

* Ensure that the DNS addresses in **/etc/resolv.conf** are accessible; otherwise, it may cause DNS issues in the cluster.

* If your network configuration uses firewall rules or security groups, make sure that the infrastructure components can communicate with each other through specific ports. It is recommended to disable the firewall.

* Supported CNI plugins: Calico and Flannel. Other plugins such as Cilium and Kube-OVN are also compatible, but note that they have not been fully tested.

== Port Requirements

Certain ports are used for communication between services. If you have firewall rules in your network configuration, ensure that the infrastructure components can communicate with each other through specific ports. These ports serve as communication endpoints for certain processes or services.
