This section explains how to install Kubernetes and {ks_product-en}.

The installation process will use the open-source tool KubeKey. For more information about KubeKey, please visit the link:https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey[GitHub KubeKey repository].

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|You can also run the command in the link:#_install_kubesphere[Install KubeSphere] section to directly upgrade KubeSphere from v4.1.1 to v4.1.2.
|===

== Prerequisites

* Prepare at least 1 Linux server as a cluster node. In a production environment, to ensure high availability of the cluster, it is recommended to prepare at least 5 Linux servers, with 3 servers as control plane nodes and 2 servers as worker nodes. If you are installing {ks_product-en} on multiple Linux servers, make sure all servers belong to the same subnet.

* The operating system and version of the cluster nodes must be Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 9, Debian 10, CentOS 7, CentOS Stream, RHEL 7, RHEL 8, SLES 15, or openSUSE Leap 15. The operating systems of multiple servers can be different. For support of other operating systems and versions, please contact {ks_product-en} technical support.

* In a production environment, to ensure the cluster has sufficient computing and storage resources, it is recommended that each cluster node be configured with at least 8 CPU cores, 16 GB of memory, and 200 GB of disk space. In addition, it is recommended to mount an additional 200 GB of disk space in the **/var/lib/docker** (for Docker) or **/var/lib/containerd** (for containerd) directory of each cluster node for storing container runtime data.

* In a production environment, it is recommended to configure high availability for the KubeSphere cluster in advance to avoid service interruption in the event of a single control plane node failure. For more information, please refer to the link:../../../03-installation-and-upgrade/01-preparations/02-configure-high-availability/02-configure-k8s-high-availability/[Configure High Availability].
+
--
// Note
include::../../../../_ks_components-en/admonitions/note.adoc[]

If you plan to have multiple control plane nodes, be sure to configure high availability for the cluster in advance.

include::../../../../_ks_components-en/admonitions/admonEnd.adoc[]
--

* By default, KubeSphere uses the local disk space of the cluster nodes as persistent storage. In a production environment, it is recommended to configure an external storage system as persistent storage in advance. For more information, please refer to the link:../../../03-installation-and-upgrade/01-preparations/04-configure-external-persistent-storage/[Configure External Persistent Storage].

* If the cluster nodes do not have a container runtime installed, the installation tool KubeKey will automatically install Docker as the container runtime for each cluster node during the installation process. You can also manually install containerd, CRI-O, or iSula as the container runtime in advance.
+
--
// Note
include::../../../../_ks_components-en/admonitions/note.adoc[]

CRI-O and iSula have not been fully tested for compatibility with KubeSphere, and there may be unknown issues.

include::../../../../_ks_components-en/admonitions/admonEnd.adoc[]
--

* Make sure the DNS server addresses configured in the **/etc/resolv.conf** file on all cluster nodes are available. Otherwise, the KubeSphere cluster may encounter domain name resolution issues.

* Make sure you can use the **sudo**, **curl**, and **openssl** commands on all cluster nodes.

* Make sure the time is synchronized on all cluster nodes.


== Configure Firewall Rules

KubeSphere requires specific ports and protocols for communication between services. If your infrastructure environment has enabled a firewall, you need to open the required ports and protocols in the firewall settings. If your infrastructure environment does not have a firewall enabled, you can skip this step.

The following table lists the ports and protocols that need to be opened in the firewall.

== Install Dependencies

You need to install socat, conntrack, ebtables, and ipset for all cluster nodes. If the above dependencies already exist on each cluster node, you can skip this step.

On Ubuntu systems, run the following command to install the dependencies on the servers:

// Bash
[,bash]
----
sudo apt install socat conntrack ebtables ipset -y
----

If the cluster nodes use other operating systems, replace **apt** with the corresponding package management tool for the operating system.

// endif::[]

// ifeval::["{file_output_type}" == "html"]
include::../../../_custom-en/installationAndUpgrade/installationAndUpgrade-oper-downloadKubekey.adoc[]
// endif::[]

. Create the installation configuration file **config-sample.yaml**:
+
--
//Bash
[,bash]
----
 ./kk create config --with-kubernetes <Kubernetes version>
----

Replace `<Kubernetes version>` with the actual version needed, for example **v1.27.4**.

After the command completes, the installation configuration file **config-sample.yaml** will be generated.

include::../../../_custom-en/installationAndUpgrade/installationAndUpgrade-note-doNotDeleteConfig_v4.adoc[]
--

. Edit **config-sample.yaml**：
+
--
//Bash
[,bash]
----
vi config-sample.yaml
----

== Install KubeSphere

KubeSphere Core (ks-core) is the core component of KubeSphere, providing a foundational runtime environment for extensions. Once KubeSphere Core is installed, you can access the {ks_product-en} web console.

. `Helm` should have been installed in advance. For specific instructions, please refer to link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/[Helm Installation].
+
[,bash]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
----

. Run the following command on the cluster node to install KubeSphere Core.
+
====
[,bash]
----
# If you are accessing charts.kubesphere.io from a restricted location, replace charts.kubesphere.io with charts.kubesphere.com.cn
helm upgrade --install -n kubesphere-system --create-namespace ks-core https://charts.kubesphere.io/main/ks-core-1.1.4.tgz --debug --wait
----

include::../../../../_ks_components-en/admonitions/note.adoc[]

If you are accessing Docker Hub from a restricted location, add the following configuration after the above command to modify the default image pull address.

[,bash]
----
--set global.imageRegistry=swr.cn-southwest-2.myhuaweicloud.com/ks
----

[,bash]
----
--set extension.imageRegistry=swr.cn-southwest-2.myhuaweicloud.com/ks
----

include::../../../../_ks_components-en/admonitions/admonEnd.adoc[]

If you see the following information, it means that ks-core installation is successful:

[,yaml]
----
NOTES:
Thank you for choosing KubeSphere Helm Chart.

Please be patient and wait for several seconds for the KubeSphere deployment to complete.

1. Wait for Deployment Completion

    Confirm that all KubeSphere components are running by executing the following command:

    kubectl get pods -n kubesphere-system

2. Access the KubeSphere Console

    Once the deployment is complete, you can access the KubeSphere console using the following URL:

    http://192.168.6.10:30880

3. Login to KubeSphere Console

    Use the following credentials to log in:

    Account: admin
    Password: P@88w0rd

NOTE: It is highly recommended to change the default password immediately after the first login.

For additional information and details, please visit https://kubesphere.io.
----
====

. From the successful information, retrieve the **Console**, **Account**, and **Password** parameters to obtain the IP address of the {ks_product-en} web console, the admin username, and the admin password. Use a web browser to log in to the {ks_product-en} web console.
