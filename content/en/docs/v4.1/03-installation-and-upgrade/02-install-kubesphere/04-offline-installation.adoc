This section explains how to use KubeKey to create an image package in a connected environment and deploy Kubernetes and KubeSphere in an air-gapped environment.

== Prerequisites

* Prepare at least three hosts as shown below.
+
[%header,cols="1a,1a, 4a"]
|===
|Host IP |Host Name |Role

|192.168.0.2 |node1 |Internet-connected host, used to create image packages
|192.168.0.3 |master |Control plane node of the air-gapped environment
|192.168.0.4 |node2 |Image registry node of the air-gapped environment (can be ignored if you already have an image registry)
|===

* Install `socat` and `conntrack` on master and node2.
+
--
[,bash]
----
apt install socat conntrack -y
----

If the cluster nodes use other operating systems, replace **apt** with the corresponding package manager for the operating system.
--

== Get Version Information and Image List

. Visit https://get-images.kubesphere.io/

. Select the extensions you want to deploy.

. Enter your email address.

. Click **Get Image List**.

. Check your email to get the latest version information of KubeSphere and the image list files.
+
--
Image list files are as follows:

[%header,cols="1a,3a"]
|===
|File Name |Description

| `kubesphere-images.txt`
|Contains all images related to KubeSphere and extensions, as well as their image addresses on Huawei Cloud. You can use the list in this file to synchronize images to your offline registry.

| `kk-manifest.yaml`
|Contains all images related to KubeSphere and extensions, which can be used to quickly build image packages with `kk`.

| `kk-manifest-mirror.yaml`
|Contains all images related to KubeSphere and extensions on Huawei Cloud's image registry. You can use this manifest file to build image packages when DockerHub access is restricted.
|===
--

== Build Image Package

Log in to the internet-connected node `node1` and follow the steps below to build the KubeSphere image package.

=== 1. Install KubeKey

Run the following command to install KubeKey.

After the download is complete, the KubeKey binary file **kk** will be generated in the current directory.

[source,bash]
----
curl -sSL https://get-kk.kubesphere.io | sh -
----

=== 2. Create Manifest File

[.admon.attention,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
If you only want to use `kk` to package KubeSphere images into the air-gapped environment, you can directly use the manifest file received in the email to link:#_4_build_image_package[Build Image Package]. No need to create or edit the manifest file.
|===

If you want to use `kk` to deploy Kubernetes and the image registry, follow the steps below:

. If you have restricted access to DockerHub, run the following command to replace the Kubernetes image address with the Alibaba Cloud registry.
+
[,bash]
----
export KKZONE=cn
----

. Create the manifests file.
+
--
[source,bash]
----
# If you need to use kk to deploy the image registry offline, add --with-registry to package the installation files for the image registry
./kk create manifest --with-kubernetes v1.26.12 --with-registry
----

This command will create a `manifest-sample.yaml` file.
--

=== 3. Edit Manifest File

If you want to use `kk` to deploy Kubernetes and the image registry, add the KubeSphere image list obtained from the email to the newly created manifest file.

. Open the manifest file.
+
[source,bash]
----
vi manifest-sample.yaml
----

. Copy the image list from `kk-manifest.yaml` or `kk-manifest-mirror.yaml` (if DockerHub access is restricted) and add it to the newly created `manifest-sample.yaml` file.
+
--
[.admon.attention,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|The image list in the following manifest file is for example only. Please get the latest image list through https://get-images.kubesphere.io/.

== Air-gapped Deployment

=== 1. Preparations

Sync the three files from the internet-connected host `node1` to the master node in the air-gapped environment.

* `kk`
* `kubesphere.tar.gz`
* `ks-core-1.1.3.tgz`

=== 2. Create Configuration File

. Create a configuration file for the air-gapped cluster.
+
[source,bash]
----
./kk create config --with-kubernetes v1.26.12
----

. Modify the configuration file.
+
--
[source,bash]
----
vi config-sample.yaml
----

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
* Modify the node information according to the actual configuration of the air-gapped environment.
* Specify the node where the `registry` to deploy, used for KubeKey to deploy the Harbor registry.
* In `registry`, the value of `type` can be specified as `harbor`. Otherwise, the docker registry is installed by default.
* For Kubernetes v1.24+, it is recommended to set `containerManager` to `containerd`.

=== 3. Create Image Registry

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
If you already have an image registry, you can skip this step.
|===

Run the following command to create the image registry.

[source,bash]
----
./kk init registry -f config-sample.yaml -a kubesphere.tar.gz
----

* `config-sample.yaml` is the configuration file for the air-gapped cluster.

* `kubesphere.tar.gz` is the installation package containing the images of ks-core and all extensions.

If the following message is displayed, the image registry has been created successfully.

[source,bash]
----
Pipeline[InitRegistryPipeline] execute successfully
----

=== 4. Create Harbor Projects (if the Image Registry is Harbor)

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
As Harbor adopts the Role-based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism, which means that only specified users can perform certain operations. Therefore, you must create a project before pushing images to Harbor. Harbor supports two types of projects:

* Public Project: Any user can pull images from the project.
* Private Project: Only project members can pull images from the project.

Harbor admin account: **admin**, password: **Harbor12345**.

The harbor installation files are in the `/opt/harbor` directory, where you can perform maintenance on harbor.
|===

Run the following command to create Harbor projects.

. Create the configuration script.

=== 5. Install Kubernetes

Run the following command to create the Kubernetes cluster:

[source,bash]
----
./kk create cluster -f config-sample.yaml -a kubesphere.tar.gz --with-local-storage
----

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
Specifying the --with-local-storage parameter will default to deploying `openebs localpv`. If you need to connect to other storage, you can install it later after the Kubernetes cluster is deployed.
|===

If the following message is displayed, the Kubernetes cluster has been created successfully.

[source,bash]
----
Pipeline[CreateclusterPipeline] execute successfully
Installation is complete.
----

=== 6. Install KubeSphere

. Install KubeSphere.

--
[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade --install -n kubesphere-system --create-namespace ks-core ks-core-1.1.3.tgz \
     --set global.imageRegistry=dockerhub.kubekey.local/ks \
     --set extension.imageRegistry=dockerhub.kubekey.local/ks \
     --set ksExtensionRepository.image.tag=v1.1.2 \
     --debug \
     --wait
----
[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
* `ksExtensionRepository.image.tag` is the Extensions Museum version obtained earlier (i.e., the latest extension repository version displayed on https://get-images.kubesphere.io/).

* If you need to deploy high availability in KubeSphere, add `--set ha.enabled=true,redisHA.enabled=true` to the command.

If the following message is displayed, KubeSphere has been installed successfully:

NOTES:
Thank you for choosing KubeSphere Helm Chart.

Please be patient and wait for several seconds for the KubeSphere deployment to complete.

1. Wait for Deployment Completion

    Confirm that all KubeSphere components are running by executing the following command:

    kubectl get pods -n kubesphere-system
2. Access the KubeSphere Console

    Once the deployment is complete, you can access the KubeSphere console using the following URL:

    http://192.168.6.6:30880

3. Login to KubeSphere Console

    Use the following credentials to log in:

    Account: admin
    Password: P@88w0rd

NOTE: It is highly recommended to change the default password immediately after the first login.
For additional information and details, please visit https://kubesphere.io.
----
--

. From the successful information, retrieve the **Console**, **Account**, and **Password** parameters to obtain the IP address of the {ks_product-en} web console, the admin username, and the admin password. Use a web browser to log in to the {ks_product-en} web console.
