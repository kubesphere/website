This section introduces how to use the "KubeSphere Gateway" extension to enable and manage gateways for clusters, workspaces, and projects.

include::../../../_custom-en/clusterManagement/gatewaySettings/gatewaySettings-desc-gateway.adoc[]

KubeSphere provides a cluster gateway for each cluster, a workspace gateway for each workspace in the cluster, and a project gateway for each project in the workspace, respectively used to provide reverse proxy for services in the entire cluster, a single workspace, and a single project.

After installing the "KubeSphere Gateway" extension,

* The **Gateway Settings** option will be displayed under the **Cluster Settings** menu in the left navigation pane of the cluster;
* The **Gateway Settings** option will be displayed under the **Workspace Settings** menu in the left navigation pane of the workspace;
* The **Gateway Settings** option will be displayed under the **Project Settings** menu in the left navigation pane of the project.
