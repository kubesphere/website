== 告警规则参数描述

告警规则目前支持三种类型：审计、事件和日志。在 `spec.type` 下配置不同类型的告警规则，如 `type: auditing`，`type: events` 或 `type: logs` 。

告警规则  `spec.rules` 的设置项如下：
[%header,cols="1a,4a"]
|===
|参数 |描述

|`name`
| 规则名称。

|`desc`
| 规则描述。

|`expr.kind`
|规则类型，取值可以为 `rule`, `macro`, `list`, 或 `alias`。

|`expr.condition`
|日志的过滤表达式，以检查日志是否与规则匹配。可使用比较运算符（=，!=，<，<=，>，>=，contains，in，like，regexp）、布尔运算符（and，or 和 not）以及括号进行组合。

|`expr.macro` 
| macro 的条件。

|`expr.list`
| list 的值。

|`expr.alias`
| alias 的值。

|`enable`
| 如果为 false，规则将不生效。

|`alerts.output`
| 指定在匹配事件发生时输出的消息。

|`alerts.annotations`
| 规则的注解，包含在匹配事件发生时输出的告警消息。

|`alerts.annotations.summary`
| 指定在匹配事件发生时输出的摘要消息。

|`alerts.annotations.summaryCn`
| 指定在匹配事件发生时输出的中文摘要消息。

|`alerts.severity` 
| 规则的告警级别，取值可以为 INFO、WARNING、ERROR、或 CRITICAL。
|===

**Macro**

宏（Macro）是规则条件片段，可以在规则内部甚至其他宏中重复使用。宏提供了一种命名常见模式和消除规则冗余的方法。以下是一个宏的示例：

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: macro-rule
spec:
  type: auditing
  rules:
  - desc: pod
    expr:
      kind: macro
      macro: ObjectRef.Resource="pods"
    name: pod
----

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|说明

|
宏可以在规则或其他宏中使用，例如 `${pod}` 或 `${alerting-rule.pod}` 。这两种方法的区别在于 `${pod}` 只能用于 `alerting-rule`，而 `${alerting-rule.pod}` 可以用于所有实例。宏也可用于 list 和 alias。
|===

**List**

列表（List）是可以包含在规则、宏或其他列表中的项目集合。与规则和宏不同，列表不能被解析为过滤表达式。以下是一个列表的示例：

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: list-rule
spec:
  type: alerting
  rules:
  - desc: all action not need to be audit
    expr:
      kind: list
      list:
        - get
        - list
        - watch
    name: ignore-action
----

**Alias**

别名（Alias）是过滤字段的缩写名称，它可以包含在规则、宏、列表和输出字符串中。以下是一个别名的示例：

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: alias-rule
spec:
  type: alerting
  rules:
  - desc: the alias of the user related to audit event
    expr:
      alias: User.username
      kind: alias
    name: user
----
