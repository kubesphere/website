== Parameter Description

Alert Rules currently support three types: auditing, events, and logs. Configure different types of alert rules under `spec.type`, such as `type: auditing`, `type: events`, or `type: logs`.

The settings for `spec.rules` in alert rules are as follows:

[%header,cols="1a,4a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`name`
| The name of the rule.

|`desc`
| The description of the rule.

|`expr.kind`
| The type of the rule, which can be `rule`, `macro`, `list`, or `alias`.

|`expr.condition`
| The filtering expression for logs to check if the logs match the rule. You can use comparison operators (=, !=, <, <=, >, >=, contains, in, like, regexp), boolean operators (and, or, not), and parentheses for combinations.

|`expr.macro` 
| The condition for the macro.

|`expr.list`
| The value for the list.

|`expr.alias`
| The value for the alias.

|`enable`
| If false, the rule will not take effect.

|`alerts.output`
| Specifies the message to output when a matching event occurs.

|`alerts.annotations`
| Annotations for the rule, included in the alert message when a matching event occurs.

|`alerts.annotations.summary`
| Specifies the summary message to output when a matching event occurs.

|`alerts.annotations.summaryCn`
| Specifies the Chinese summary message to output when a matching event occurs.

|`alerts.severity` 
| The alert level of the rule, which can be INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL.
|===

**Macro**

A macro is a snippet of a rule condition that can be reused within rules or even other macros. Macros provide a way to name common patterns and eliminate rule redundancy. Here is an example of a macro:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: macro-rule
spec:
  type: auditing
  rules:
  - desc: pod
    expr:
      kind: macro
      macro: ObjectRef.Resource="pods"
    name: pod
----

[.admon.note,cols="a"]
|===
|Note

|
Macros can be used in rules or other macros, such as `${pod}` or `${alerting-rule.pod}`. The difference between these two methods is that `${pod}` can only be used in `alerting-rule`, while `${alerting-rule.pod}` can be used in all instances. Macros can also be used in lists and aliases.
|===

**List**

A list is a collection of items that can be included in rules, macros, or other lists. Unlike rules and macros, lists cannot be resolved into filtering expressions. Here is an example of a list:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: list-rule
spec:
  type: alerting
  rules:
  - desc: all action not need to be audit
    expr:
      kind: list
      list:
        - get
        - list
        - watch
    name: ignore-action
----

**Alias**

An alias is an abbreviated name for a filtering field that can be included in rules, macros, lists, and output strings. Here is an example of an alias:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.whizard.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterRuleGroup
metadata:
  name: alias-rule
spec:
  type: alerting
  rules:
  - desc: the alias of the user related to audit event
    expr:
      alias: User.username
      kind: alias
    name: user
