KubeSphere supports the query of auditing logs among isolated tenants. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the query function, including the interface, search parameters and detail pages.

## Prerequisites

You need to enable [KubeSphere Auditing Logs](../../../pluggable-components/auditing-logs/).

## Enter the Query Interface

1. The query function is available for all users. Log in to the console with any account, hover over the **Toolbox** in the lower right corner and select **Auditing Operating**.

   {{< notice note >}} 

Any account has the authorization to query auditing logs, while the logs each account is able to see are different.

- If an account has the authorization of viewing resources in a project, it can see the auditing log that happens in this project, such as workload creation in the project.
- If an account has the authorization of listing projects in a workspace, it can see the auditing log that happens in this workspace but not in projects, such as project creation in the workspace.
- If an account has the authorization of listing projects in a cluster, it can see the auditing log that happens in this cluster but not in workspaces and projects, such as workspace creation in the cluster.

2. As shown in the pop-up window, you can see trends in the total number of auditing logs in the last 12 hours.

3. The **Auditing Operating** console supports the following query parameters:

   Parameter         | Description
 ---               | --- 
 Cluster           | The cluster where the operation happens. It is enabled if the [multi-cluster feature](../../../multicluster-management/) is turned on. 
 Project           | The project where the operation happens. It supports exact query and fuzzy query. 
 Workspace         | The workspace where the operation happens. It supports exact query and fuzzy query. 
 Resource Type     | The type of resource associated with the request. It supports fuzzy query.
 Resource Name     | The name of the resource associated with the request. It supports fuzzy query.
 Verb              | The Kubernetes verb associated with the request. For non-resource requests, this is the lower-case HTTP method. It supports exact query. 
 Status Code       | The Http response code. It supports exact query. 
 Operation Account | The user who calls this request. It supports exact and fuzzy query. 
 Source IP         | The IP address from where the request originated and intermediate proxies. It supports fuzzy query. 
 Time Range        | The time when the request reaches the apiserver. 

   {{< notice note >}} 

- Fuzzy query supports case-insensitive fuzzy matching and retrieval of full terms by the first half of a word or phrase based on Elasticsearch segmentation rules.
- KubeSphere stores logs for the last seven days by default. You can modify the retention period in the ConfigMap `elasticsearch-logging-curator`.

## Enter Query Parameters

1. Select a filter and input the keyword you want to search. For example, query auditing logs containing the information of `user` changed as shown in the following screenshot:

   ![User Changed](/images/docs/toolbox/user-changed.png)

2. Click any one of the results from the list, and you can see the detail of the auditing log.
