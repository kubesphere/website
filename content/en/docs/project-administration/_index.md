A KubeSphere project is a Kubernetes namespace. There are two types of projects, the single-cluster project and the multi-cluster project. The former one is the regular Kubernetes namespace, while the latter is the federated namespace across multiple clusters. As a project administrator, you are responsible for project creation, limit range settings, network isolation configuration, and more.
