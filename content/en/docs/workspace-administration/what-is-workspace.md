Workspace is a logical unit to organize your [projects](../../project-administration/), [DevOps projects](../../devops-user-guide/) and [application management](../upload-helm-based-application/). It is the place for you to manage resource access and share resources within your team in a secure way.

It is a best practice to create a new workspace for a tenant (non-cluster admin). A tenant can work in multiple workspaces, while a workspace allows multiple tenants to acces in different access modes.
