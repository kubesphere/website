A workspace is a logical unit to organize your [projects](../../project-administration/) and [DevOps projects](../../devops-user-guide/) and manage [app templates](../upload-helm-based-application/) and app repositories. It is the place for you to control resource access and share resources within your team in a secure way.

It is a best practice to create a new workspace for tenants (excluding cluster administrators). A same tenant can work in multiple workspaces, while a workspace allows multiple tenants to access it in different ways.

This tutorial demonstrates how to create and delete a workspace.

## Prerequisites

You have a user granted the role of `workspaces-manager`, such as `ws-manager` in [Create Workspaces, Projects, Users and Roles](../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/).

## Create a Workspace

1. Log in to the web console of KubeSphere as `ws-manager`. Click **Platform** on the upper-left corner, and then select **Access Control**. On the **Workspaces** page, click **Create**.

   {{< notice note >}}

   By default, you have at least one workspace `system-workspace` in the list which contains all system projects.

   {{</ notice >}}

2. On the **Basic Information** page, specify a name for the workspace and select an administrator from the drop-down list. Click **Create** to continue.

   - **Name**: Set a name for the workspace which serves as a unique identifier.
   - **Alias**: An alias name for the workspace.
   - **Administrator**: Account that administers the workspace.
   - **Description**: A brief introduction of the workspace.

3. The workspace is displayed in the workspace list after it is created.

4. Click the workspace and you can see resource statusof the workspace on the **Overview** page.

## Delete a Workspace

In KubeSphere, you use a workspace to group and manage different projects, which means the lifecycle of a project is dependent on the workspace. More specifically, all the projects and related resources in a workspace will be deleted if the workspace is deleted.

Before you delete a workspace, decide whether you want to unbind some key projects.

### Unbind projects before deletion

To delete a workspace while preserving some projects in it, run the following command first:

```bash
kubectl label ns <namespace> kubesphere.io/workspace- && kubectl patch ns <namespace>   -p '{"metadata":{"ownerReferences":[]}}' --type=merge
```

{{< notice note >}} 

The command above removes labels associated with the workspace and removes ownerReferences. After that, you can [assign an unbound project to a new workspace](../../faq/access-control/add-kubernetes-namespace-to-kubesphere-workspace/).

### Delete a workspace on the console

After you unbind necessary projects from a workspace, perform the following steps to delete a workspace.

{{< notice note >}} 

Be extremely cautious about deleting a workspace if you use kubectl to delete workspace resource objects directly.

{{</ notice >}} 

1. In your workspace, go to **Basic Information** under **Workspace Settings**. On the **Basic Information** page, you can see the general information of the workspace, such as the number of projects and members.

   {{< notice note >}}

   On this page, you can click **Edit Information** to change the basic information of the workspace (excluding the workspace name) and turn on/off [Network Isolation](../../workspace-administration/workspace-network-isolation/).

   {{</ notice >}} 

2. To delete the workspace, click **Delete** under **Delete Workspace**. In the displayed dialog box, enter the name of the workspace, and then click **OK**.

   {{< notice warning >}}

   A workspace cannot be restored after it is deleted and resources in the workspace will also be removed.
