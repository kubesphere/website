KubeSphere tenants work in a workspace to manage projects and apps. Among others, workspace administrators are responsible for the management of app repositories. Tenants of different roles can further deploy and use app templates from app repositories. They can also leverage individual app templates which are uploaded and released to the App Store. Besides, administrators also control whether the network of a workspace is isolated from others'.

This chapter demonstrates how workspace administrators and tenants work at the workspace level.
