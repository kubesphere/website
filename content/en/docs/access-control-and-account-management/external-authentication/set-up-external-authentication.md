This document describes how to use an external identity provider such as an LDAP service or Active Directory service on KubeSphere.

KubeSphere provides a built-in OAuth server. Users can obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to the KubeSphere API. As a KubeSphere administrator, you can edit the `kubesphere-config` ConfigMap to configure OAuth and specify identity providers.

## Prerequisites

You need to deploy a Kubernetes cluster and install KubeSphere in the cluster. For details, see [Installing on Linux](/docs/installing-on-linux/) and [Installing on Kubernetes](/docs/installing-on-kubernetes/).


## Procedure

1. Log in to KubeSphere as `admin`, move the cursor to <img src="/images/docs/access-control-and-account-management/external-authentication/set-up-external-authentication/toolbox.png" width="25px"> in the bottom-right corner, click **Kubectl**, and run the following command to edit the `kubesphere-config` ConfigMap:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n kubesphere-system edit cm kubesphere-config
   ```

2. Configure fields in the `data:kubesphere.yaml:authentication` section. 

   Example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     kubesphere.yaml: |
       authentication:
         authenticateRateLimiterMaxTries: 10
         authenticateRateLimiterDuration: 10m0s
         loginHistoryRetentionPeriod: 168h
         maximumClockSkew: 10s
         multipleLogin: true
         jwtSecret: "********"
         oauthOptions:
           accessTokenMaxAge: 1h
           accessTokenInactivityTimeout: 30m
           identityProviders:
           - name: ldap
             type: LDAPIdentityProvider
             mappingMethod: auto
             provider:
               host: 192.168.0.2:389
               managerDN: uid=root,cn=users,dc=nas
               managerPassword: ********
               userSearchBase: cn=users,dc=nas
               loginAttribute: uid
               mailAttribute: mail
   ```

   The fields are described as follows:

   * `authenticateRateLimiterMaxTries`: Maximum number of consecutive login failures allowed during a period specified by `authenticateRateLimiterDuration`. If the number of consecutive login failures of a user reaches the limit, the user will be blocked. 

   * `authenticateRateLimiterDuration`: Period during which `authenticateRateLimiterMaxTries` applies.

   * `loginHistoryRetentionPeriod`: Retention period of login records. Outdated login records are automatically deleted.

   * `maximumClockSkew`: Maximum clock skew for time-sensitive operations such as token expiration validation. The default value is `10s`.

   * `multipleLogin`: Whether multiple users are allowed to log in from different locations. The default value is `true`.

   * `jwtSecret`: Secret used to sign user tokens. In a multi-cluster environment, all clusters must [use the same Secret](../../multicluster-management/enable-multicluster/direct-connection/#prepare-a-member-cluster). 

   * `oauthOptions`: OAuth settings.
     * `accessTokenMaxAge`: Access token lifetime. For member clusters in a multi-cluster environment, the default value is `0h`, which means access tokens never expire. For other clusters, the default value is `2h`.
     * `accessTokenInactivityTimeout`: Access token inactivity timeout period. An access token becomes invalid after it is idle for a period specified by this field. After an access token times out, the user needs to obtain a new access token to regain access.
     * `identityProviders`: Identity providers.
       * `name`: Identity provider name.
       * `type`: Identity provider type.
       * `mappingMethod`: Account mapping method. The value can be `auto` or `lookup`.
         *  If the value is `auto` (default), you need to specify a new username. KubeSphere automatically creates a user according to the username and maps the user to a third-party account.
         * If the value is `lookup`, you need to perform step 3 to manually map an existing KubeSphere user to a third-party account.
       * `provider`: Identity provider information. Fields in this section vary according to the identity provider type.

3. If `mappingMethod` is set to `lookup`, run the following command and add the labels to map a KubeSphere user to a third-party account. Skip this step if `mappingMethod` is set to `auto`.

   ```bash
   kubectl edit user <KubeSphere username>
   ```
   
   ```yaml
   labels:
     iam.kubesphere.io/identify-provider: <Identity provider name>
     iam.kubesphere.io/origin-uid: <Third-party username>
   ```
   
4. After the fields are configured, run the following command to restart ks-apiserver.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n kubesphere-system rollout restart deploy/ks-apiserver
   ```
