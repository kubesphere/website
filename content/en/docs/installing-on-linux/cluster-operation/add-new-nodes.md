After you use KubeSphere for a certain period of time, it is likely that you need to scale out your cluster with an increasing number of workloads. From KubeSphere v3.0.0, you can use the brand-new installer [KubeKey](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey) to add new nodes to a cluster. Fundamentally, the operation is based on Kubelet's registration mechanism. In other words, the new nodes will automatically join the existing Kubernetes cluster. KubeSphere supports hybrid environments, which means the newly-added host OS can be CentOS or Ubuntu.

This tutorial demonstrates how to add new nodes to a single-node cluster. To scale out a multi-node cluster, the steps are basically the same.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a single-node cluster. For more information, see [All-in-One Installation on Linux](../../../quick-start/all-in-one-on-linux/).

- You have [downloaded KubeKey](../../../installing-on-linux/introduction/multioverview/#step-2-download-kubekey).

## Add Worker Nodes

1. Retrieve your cluster information using KubeKey. The command below creates a configuration file (`sample.yaml`).

   ```bash
   ./kk create config --from-cluster
   ```
   
   {{< notice note >}}
   

You can skip this step if you already have the configuration file on your machine. For example, if you want to add nodes to a multi-node cluster which was set up by KubeKey, you might still have the configuration file if you have not deleted it.

{{</ notice >}} 

2. In the configuration file, put the information of your new nodes under `hosts` and `roleGroups`. The example adds two new nodes (i.e. `node1` and `node2`). Here `master1` is the existing node.

   ```bash
   ···
   spec:
     hosts:
     - {name: master1, address: 192.168.0.3, internalAddress: 192.168.0.3, user: root, password: Qcloud@123}
     - {name: node1, address: 192.168.0.4, internalAddress: 192.168.0.4, user: root, password: Qcloud@123}
     - {name: node2, address: 192.168.0.5, internalAddress: 192.168.0.5, user: root, password: Qcloud@123}
     roleGroups:
       etcd:
       - master1
       master:
       - master1
       worker:
       - node1
       - node2
   ···
   ```
   
   {{< notice note >}}
   
- For more information about the configuration file, see [Edit the configuration file](../../../installing-on-linux/introduction/multioverview/#2-edit-the-configuration-file).
- You are not allowed to modify the host name of existing nodes when adding new nodes.
- Replace the host name in the example with your own.
  
   {{</ notice >}}
3. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   ./kk add nodes -f sample.yaml
   ```

4. You will be able to see the new nodes and their information on the KubeSphere console when the installation finishes. On the **Cluster Management** page, select **Cluster Nodes** under **Nodes** from the left menu, or execute the command `kubectl get node` to check the changes.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get node
   NAME          STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
   master1       Ready    master,worker   20d   v1.17.9
   node1         Ready    worker          31h   v1.17.9
   node2         Ready    worker          31h   v1.17.9
   ```

## Add Master Nodes for High Availability

The steps of adding master nodes are generally the same as adding worker nodes while you need to configure a load balancer for your cluster. You can use any cloud load balancers or hardware load balancers (e.g. F5). In addition, Keepalived and [HAproxy](https://www.haproxy.com/), or Nginx is also an alternative for creating highly available clusters.

1. Create a configuration file using KubeKey.

   ```
   ./kk create config --from-cluster
   ```

2. Open the file and you can see some fields are pre-populated with values. Add the information of new nodes and your load balancer to the file. Here is an example for your reference:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kubekey.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Cluster
   metadata:
     name: sample
   spec:
     hosts:
     # You should complete the ssh information of the hosts
     - {name: master1, address: 172.16.0.2, internalAddress: 172.16.0.2, user: root, password: Testing123}
     - {name: master2, address: 172.16.0.5, internalAddress: 172.16.0.5, user: root, password: Testing123}
     - {name: master3, address: 172.16.0.6, internalAddress: 172.16.0.6, user: root, password: Testing123}
     - {name: worker1, address: 172.16.0.3, internalAddress: 172.16.0.3, user: root, password: Testing123}
     - {name: worker2, address: 172.16.0.4, internalAddress: 172.16.0.4, user: root, password: Testing123}
     - {name: worker3, address: 172.16.0.7, internalAddress: 172.16.0.7, user: root, password: Testing123}
     roleGroups:
       etcd:
       - master1
       - master2
       - master3
       master:
       - master1
       - master2
       - master3
       worker:
       - worker1
       - worker2
       - worker3
     controlPlaneEndpoint:
       # If loadbalancer is used, 'address' should be set to loadbalancer's ip.
       domain: lb.kubesphere.local
       address: 172.16.0.253
       port: 6443
     kubernetes:
       version: v1.17.9
       imageRepo: kubesphere
       clusterName: cluster.local
       proxyMode: ipvs
       masqueradeAll: false
       maxPods: 110
       nodeCidrMaskSize: 24
     network:
       plugin: calico
       kubePodsCIDR: 10.233.64.0/18
       kubeServiceCIDR: 10.233.0.0/18
     registry:
       privateRegistry: ""
   ```

3. Pay attention to the `controlPlaneEndpoint` field.

   ```yaml
     controlPlaneEndpoint:
       # If you use a load balancer, the address should be set to the load balancer's ip.
       domain: lb.kubesphere.local
       address: 172.16.0.253
       port: 6443
   ```

   - The domain name of the load balancer is `lb.kubesphere.local` by default for internal access. You can change it based on your needs.
   - In most cases, you need to provide the **private IP address** of the load balancer for the field `address`. However, different cloud providers may have different configurations for load balancers. For example, if you configure a Server Load Balancer (SLB) on Alibaba Cloud, the platform assigns a public IP address to the SLB, which means you need to specify the public IP address for the field `address`.
   - The field `port` indicates the port of `api-server`.

4. Save the file and execute the following command to apply the configuration.

   ```bash
   ./kk add nodes -f sample.yaml
   ```
