## Objective

KubeSphere provides alert policies for nodes and workloads. This guide demonstrates how you, as a project member, can create alert policies for workloads in the project and configure mail notifications. See [Alerting Policy (Node Level)](../../../cluster-administration/alerting/alerting-policy/) to learn how to configure alert policies for nodes.

## Prerequisites

- [KubeSphere Alerting and Notification](../../../pluggable-components/alerting-notification/) needs to be enabled by an account granted the role `platform-admin`.
- [Mail Server](../../../cluster-administration/cluster-settings/mail-server/) needs to be configured by an account granted the role `platform-admin`.
- You have been invited to one project with an `operator` role.
- You have workloads in this project. If they are not ready, go to **Applications** under **Application Workloads**, and click **Deploy Sample Application** to deploy an application quickly. For more information, see [Deploy Bookinfo and Manage Traffic](../../../quick-start/deploy-bookinfo-to-k8s/).

## Hands-on Lab

### Task 1: Create an Alert Policy

Log in to the console and go to your project. Navigate to **Alerting Policy** under **Monitoring & Alerting**, then click **Create**.

### Task 2: Provide Basic Information

In the dialog that appears, fill in the basic information as follows. Click **Next** after you finish.
- **Name**: a concise and clear name as its unique identifier, such as `alert-demo`.
- **Alias**: to help you distinguish alert policies better. Chinese is supported.
- **Description**: a brief introduction to the alert policy.

### Task 3: Select Monitoring Targets

You can select three types of workloads as the monitoring targets: **Deployments**, **StatefulSets** and **DaemonSets**. Select **Deployments** as the type and `reviews-v1` and `details-v1` as monitoring targets, then click **Next**.

### Task 4: Add Alerting Rules

1. Click **Add Rule** to begin to create an alerting rule. The rule defines parameters such as metric type, check period, consecutive times, metric threshold and alert level to provide rich configurations. The check period (the second field under **Rule**) means the time interval between 2 consecutive checks of the metric. For example, `2 minutes/period` means the metric is checked every two minutes. The consecutive times (the third field under **Rule**) means the number of consecutive times that the metric meets the threshold when checked. An alert is only triggered when the actual time is equal to or is greater than the number of consecutive times set in the alert policy.

2. In this example, set those parameters to `memory usage`, `1 minute/period`, `2 consecutive times`, `>` and `20` MiB for threshold and `Major Alert` for alert level. It means KubeSphere checks the memory usage every minute, and a major alert is triggered if it is larger than 20 MiB for 2 consecutive times.  

3. Click **âˆš** to save the rule when you finish and click **Next** to continue.

{{< notice note >}}

- You can create workload-level alert policies for the following metrics:
    - CPU: `cpu usage`
    - Memory: `memory usage (including cache)`, `memory usage`
    - Network: `network data transmitting rate`, `network data receiving rate`
    - Workload Metric: `unavailable deployment replicas ratio`

### Task 5: Set Notification Rule

1. **Effective Notification Time Range** is used to set sending time of notification emails, such as `09:00 ~ 19:00`. **Notification Channel** currently only supports **Email**. You can add email addresses of members to be notified to **Notification List**.
1. **Customize Repetition Rules** defines sending period and retransmission times of notification emails. If alerts have not been resolved, the notification will be sent repeatedly after a certain period of time. Different repetition rules can also be set for different levels of alerts. Since the alert level set in the previous step is `Major Alert`, select `Alert once every 5 minutes` (sending period) in the second field for **Major Alert** and `Resend up to 3 times` in the third field (retransmission times). Refer to the following image to set notification rules:

![alerting_policy_workload_level_notification_rule](/images/docs/alerting/alerting_policy_workload_level_notification_rule.png)

3. Click **Create**, and you can see that the alert policy is successfully created.

### Task 6: View Alert Policy

After an alert policy is successfully created, you can enter its detail information page to view the status, alert rules, monitoring targets, notification rule, alert history, etc. Click **More** and select **Change Status** from the drop-down menu to enable or disable this alert policy.
