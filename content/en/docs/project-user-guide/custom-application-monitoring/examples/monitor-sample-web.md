This section walks you through monitoring a sample web application. The application is instrumented with Prometheus Go client in its code. Therefore, it can expose metrics directly without the help of exporters.

## Prerequisites

- Please make sure you [enable the OpenPitrix system](../../../../pluggable-components/app-store/).
- You need to create a workspace, a project, and a user account for this tutorial. For more information, see [Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role](../../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/). The account needs to be a platform regular user and to be invited as the workspace self provisioner with the `self-provisioner` role. Namely, create an account `workspace-self-provisioner` of the `self-provisioner` role, and use this account to create a project (e.g. `test`). In this tutorial, you log in as `workspace-self-provisioner` and work in the project `test` in the workspace `demo-workspace`.

- Knowledge of Helm Chart and [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/examples/).

## Hands-on Lab

### Step 1: Prepare Sample Web Application Image

First, prepare the sample web application image. The sample web application exposes a user-defined metric called `myapp_processed_ops_total`. It is a counter type metric that counts the number of operations that have been processed by far. The counter increases automatically by one every 2 seconds.

This sample application exposes application-specific metrics via the endpoint `http://localhost:2112/metrics`.

In this tutorial, you use the made-ready image `kubespheredev/promethues-example-app`. The source code can be found in [kubesphere/prometheus-example-app](https://github.com/kubesphere/prometheus-example-app). You can also follow [Instrument A Go Application For Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/) in the official documentation of Prometheus.

### Step 2: Pack the Application into a Helm Chart

Pack the Deployment, Service, and ServiceMonitor YAML template into a helm chat for reuse. In the Deployment and Service template, you define sample web container and the port for the metrics endpoint. ServiceMonitor is a custom resource defined and used by Prometheus Operator. It connects your application and KubeSphere monitoring engine (Prometheus) so that the engine knows where and how to scrape metrics. In future releases, KubeSphere will provide a graphical user interface for easy operation.

Find the source code in the folder `helm` in [kubesphere/prometheus-example-app](https://github.com/kubesphere/prometheus-example-app). The helm chart package is made ready and is named as `prometheus-example-app-0.1.0.tgz`. Please download the .tgz file and you will use it in the next step.

### Step 3: Upload the Helm Chart

1. Go to the workspace **Overview** page of `demo-workspace` and navigate to **App Templates**.

    ![app-template-create](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/app-template-create.jpg)

2. Click **Create** and upload `prometheus-example-app-0.1.0.tgz` as images below.

    ![click-upload-app-template](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/click-upload-app-template.jpg)

    ![click-upload-app-template-6](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/click-upload-app-template-6.jpg)

### Step 4: Deploy Sample Web Application

You need to deploy the sample web application into `demo`. For demonstration purposes, you can simply run a test deployment.

1. Click `prometheus-example-app`.

    ![deploy-sample-web-1](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/deploy-sample-web-1.jpg)

2. Expand the menu and click **Test Deploy**.

    ![deploy-sample-web-3](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/deploy-sample-web-3.jpg)

3. Make sure you deploy the sample web application in `test` and click **Next**.

    ![deploy-sample-web-4](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/deploy-sample-web-4.jpg)

4. Make sure `serviceMonitor.enabled` is set to `true` and click **Deploy**.

    ![deploy-sample-web-5](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/deploy-sample-web-5.jpg)

    ![deploy-sample-web-6](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/deploy-sample-web-6.jpg)

5. In **Workloads** of the project `test`, wait until the sample web application is up and running.

### Step 5: Create Dashboard

This section guides you on how to create a dashboard from scratch. You will create a text chart showing the total number of processed operations and a line chart for displaying the operation rate.

1. Navigate to **Custom Monitoring** and click **Create**.

    ![create-dashboard-2](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/create-dashboard-2.jpg)

2. Set a name (e.g. `sample-web`) and click **Create**.

    ![create-dashboard-3](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/create-dashboard-3.jpg)

3. Enter a title in the top left corner (e.g. `Sample Web Overview`).

    ![create-dashboard-4](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/create-dashboard-4.jpg)

4. Click the **plus icon** on the left column to create a text chart.

    ![create-dashboard-5](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/create-dashboard-5.jpg)

5. Type the PromQL expression `myapp_processed_ops_total` in the field **Monitoring Metrics** and give a chart name (e.g. `Operation Count`). Click **âˆš** in the bottom right corner to continue.

    ![create-dashboard-6](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/create-dashboard-6.jpg)

6. Click **Add Monitoring Item** to create a line chart.

    ![create-dashboard-7](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/create-dashboard-7.jpg)

    ![create-dashboard-8](/images/docs/project-user-guide/custom-application-monitoring/create-dashboard-8.jpg)

7. Type the PromQL expression `irate(myapp_processed_ops_total[3m])` for **Monitoring Metrics** and name the chart `Operation Rate`. To improve the appearance, you can set **Metric Name** to `{{service}}`. It will name each line with the value of the metric label `service`. Next, set **Decimal Places** to `2` so that the result will be truncated to two decimal places.

8. Click **Save Template** to save it.
