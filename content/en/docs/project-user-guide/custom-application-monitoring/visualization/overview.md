This section introduces monitoring dashboard features. You will learn how to visualize metric data in KubeSphere for your custom apps. If you do not know how to integrate your app metrics into the KubeSphere monitoring system, read [Introduction](../../introduction/) first.

## Create a Monitoring Dashboard

To create new dashboards for your app metrics, navigate to **Custom Monitoring** under **Monitoring  & Alerting** in a project. There are three ways to create monitoring dashboards: built-in templates, blank templates for customization and YAML files.

There are three available built-in templates for MySQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis respectively. These templates are for demonstration purposes and are updated with KubeSphere releases. Besides, you can choose to customize monitoring dashboards.

A KubeSphere custom monitoring dashboard can be seen as simply a YAML configuration file. The data model is heavily inspired by [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), an open-source tool for monitoring and observability. Please find KubeSphere monitoring dashboard data model design in [kubesphere/monitoring-dashboard](https://github.com/kubesphere/monitoring-dashboard). The configuration file is portable and sharable. You are welcome to contribute dashboard templates to the KubeSphere community via [Monitoring Dashboards Gallery](https://github.com/kubesphere/monitoring-dashboard/tree/master/contrib/gallery).

### From a built-in template

To help you quickly get started, KubeSphere provides built-in templates for MySQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. If you want to create dashboards from built-in templates, select a template and then click **Create**.

### From a blank template

To start with a blank template, click **Create**.

### From a YAML file

Toggle to **Edit Mode** in the top right corner then paste your dashboard YAML file.

## Dashboard Layout

The monitoring dashboard is composed of four parts. Global settings are on the top of the page. The left-most column is for text-based charts showing the current value of metrics. The middle column contains chart collections for visualizing metrics over a specific period. The right-most column presents detailed information in charts.

### Top bar

On the top bar, you can configure the following settings: title, theme, time range, and refresh interval.

### Text chart column

You can add new text charts in the left-most column.

### Detail column

You can view chart details in the right-most column. It shows the **max**, **min**, **avg** and **last** value of metrics within the specific period.

## Edit the monitoring dashboard

You can modify an existing template by clicking **Edit Template** in the top right corner.

### Add a chart

To add text charts, click the **add icon** in the left column. To add charts in the middle column, click **Add Monitoring Item** in the bottom right corner.

### Add a monitoring group

To group monitoring items, you can drag and drop an item (the six dots on the right) into the target group. To add a new group, click **Add Monitoring Group**. If you want to change the place of a group, click the **Up** or **Down** arrow on the right.

{{< notice note >}}

The place of group on the right is consistent with the place of charts in the middle. In other words, if you change the order of groups, the place of their respective charts will also change accordingly.
