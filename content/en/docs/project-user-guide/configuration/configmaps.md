A Kubernets [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) is used to store configuration data in the form of key-value pairs. The ConfigMap resource provides a way to inject configuration data into Pods. The data stored in a ConfigMap object can be referenced in a volume of type ConfigMap and then consumed by containerized applications running in a Pod. ConfigMaps are often used in the following cases:

- Set the value of the environment variable.
- Set command parameters in the container.
- Create a config file in the volume.

## Prerequisites

- You need to create a workspace, a project and an account (`project-regular`). Please refer to [Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project) if they are not ready yet.
- You need to sign in with the `project-admin` account and invite `project-regular` to the corresponding project. Please refer to [the steps to invite a member](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project#task-3-create-a-project).

## Create a Configmap

### Step 1: Open Dashboard

Log in the console as `project-regular`. Go to **Configurations** of a project, choose **ConfigMaps** and click **Create**.
