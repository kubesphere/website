A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment object, and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. As a Deployment runs a number of replicas of your application, it automatically replaces instances that go down or malfunction. This is how Deployments make sure app instances are available to handle user requests.

For more information, see the [official documentation of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

## Prerequisites

- You need to create a workspace, a project and an account (`project-regular`). Please refer to [Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project) if they are not ready yet.
- You need to sign in with the `project-admin` account and invite `project-regular` to the corresponding project. Please refer to [these steps to invite a member](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project#task-3-create-a-project).

## Create a Deployment

### Step 1: Open Dashboard

Log in the console as `project-regular`. Go to **Workloads** of a project, choose **Deployments** and click **Create**.

### Step 2: Input Basic Information

Specify a name for the Deployment (e.g. `demo-deployment`) and click **Next** to continue.

![deployments](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/deployments_form_1.jpg)

### Step 3: Set Image

1. Before you set an image, define the number of replicated Pods in **Pod Replicas** by clicking the **plus** or **minus** icon, which is indicated by the `.spec.replicas` field in the manifest file.

{{< notice tip >}}

You can see the Deployment manifest file in YAML format by enabling **Edit Mode** in the top right corner. KubeSphere allows you to edit the manifest file directly to create a Deployment. Alternatively, you can follow the steps below to create a Deployment via the dashboard.

2. Click the **Add Container Image** area.

![deployments](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/deployments_form_2_container_btn.jpg)

3. You can input an image name to use the image from public Docker Hub or select an image from a private repository you want to use. For example, input `nginx` in the search bar and press **Enter**.

![deployments](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/deployments_form_2_container_1.jpg)

{{< notice note >}} 

- Remember to press **Enter** on your keyboard after you input an image name in the search bar.
- If you want to use your private image repository, you should create a Docker Hub secret first in **Secrets** under **Configurations**.

{{</ notice >}} 

4. Set requests and limits for CPU and memory resources based on your needs. For more information, see [Resource Request and Resource Limit in Container Image Settings](../container-image-settings/#add-container-image).

![deployments](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/deployments_form_2_container_2.jpg)

5. Click **Use Default Ports** for **Port Settings** or you can customize **Protocol**, **Name** and **Container Port**.
6. Select a policy for image pulling from the drop-down menu. For more information, see [Image Pull Policy in Container Image Settings](../container-image-settings/#add-container-image).
7. For other settings (**Health Checker**, **Start Command**, **Environment Variables**, **Container Security Context** and **Sync Host Timezone**), you can configure them on the dashboard as well. For more information, see detailed explanations of these properties in [Container Image Settings](../container-image-settings/#add-container-image). When you finish, click **âˆš** in the bottom right corner to continue.
8. Select an update strategy from the drop-down menu. It is recommended you choose **RollingUpdate**. For more information, see [Update Strategy](../container-image-settings/#update-strategy).
9. Select a deployment mode. For more information, see [Deployment Mode](../container-image-settings/#deployment-mode).
10. Click **Next** to go to the next step when you finish setting the container image.

### Step 4: Mount Volumes

You can add a volume directly or mount a ConfigMap or Secret. Alternatively, click **Next** directly to skip this step.

![deployments](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/deployments_form_3.jpg)

- **Add Volume**: Support EmptyDir and PersistentVolumeClaim.

  In **Add Volume** there are 3 kinds of volumes:

  - **Existing Volume**: Use *PVC* to mount.

    Persistent storage volumes can be used to save users' persistent data. You need to create volumes in advance so that you can choose an existing volume from the list.

  - **Temporary Volume**: Use *emptyDir* to mount.

    The temporary storage volume represents [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.cn/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir), which is first created when a Pod is assigned to a node, and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. When a Pod is removed from a node for any reason, the data in the emptyDir is deleted forever.

  - **HostPath**: Use *HostPath* to mount.

    A HostPath volume mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your Pod. This is not something that most Pods will need, but it offers a powerful escape hatch for some applications.

- **Mount ConfigMap or Secret**: Support key-value pairs in ConfigMap or Secret.

  A secret volume is used to pass sensitive information, such as passwords, to Pods. Secret volumes are backed by tmpfs (a RAM-backed filesystem) so they are never written to non-volatile storage.

  A ConfigMap is used to store configuration data in the form of key-value pairs. The ConfigMap resource provides a way to inject configuration data into Pods. The data stored in a ConfigMap object can be referenced in a volume of type ConfigMap and then consumed by containerized applications running in a Pod. ConfigMaps are often used in the following cases:

  - Set the value of the environment variable.
  - Set command parameters in the container.
  - Create a config file in the volume.

For more information about volumes, please visit [Volumes](../../storage/volumes).

{{< notice note >}}

Deployments can't use the volume template, which is different from StatefulSets.

### Step 5: Configure Advanced Settings

You can set a policy for node scheduling and add metadata in this section. When you finish, click **Create** to complete the whole process of creating a Deployment.

![deployments](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/deployments_form_4.jpg)

- **Set Node Scheduling Policy**

  You can allow Pod replicas to run on specified nodes. It is specified in the field `nodeSelector`.

- **Add Metadata**

  Additional metadata settings for resources such as **Labels** and **Annotations**.

## Check Deployment Details

- **Pod detail**

  ![deployments](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/deployments_detail_pod.png)

  - The Pod list provides detailed information of the Pod (status, node, Pod IP and resource usage).
  - You can view the container information by clicking a Pod item.
  - Click the container log icon to view output logs of the container.
  - You can view the Pod detail page by clicking the Pod name.

### Revision Records

After the resource template of workload is changed, a new log will be generated and Pods will be rescheduled for a version update. The latest 10 versions will be saved by default. You can implement a redeployment based on the change log.
