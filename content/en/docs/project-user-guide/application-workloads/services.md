## What is the Service

An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.
With Kubernetes, you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

## How to create a Service

![create_service_type](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/create_service_type.png)

Create a service that has these methods in the Kubesphere: Stateless Service, Stateful Service, and External Service. what's more you can custom creation through **Specify Workloads** and **Edit by YAML**.

*There are some information you should know:*

- The value of `annotations:kubesphere.io/serviceType` keywords is one of them **statelessservice** , **statefulservice** , **externalservice** and **None**.
- Different types of Service you created could create a different workload that it may be a **Deployment**, **StatefulSet**, or **DaemonSet** at moment.

if you want to get more information about the stateful, you should visit [StatefulSet](../statefulsets/)

## This is a demo to create a **Stateless Service**

### Step 1: click the **Create** button, choose Stateless Service

![stateless_form](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form.png)

### Step 2: input base info

![stateless_form_1](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_1.png)

These are the YAML config keywords which display in the form label

| Label       | Key                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Name        | metadata.name                          |
| Version     | apiVersion                             |
| Alias       | annotations.kubesphere.io\/alias-name  |
| Description | annotations.kubesphere.io\/description |

{{< notice tip >}}

**Name** have named two configs, `Deployment` and `Service`.

{{</ notice>}}

``` yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    version: v1
    app: xxx
  name: xxx-v1
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      version: v1
      app: xxx
  template:

    app: xxx
  name: xxx

      labels:
        version: v1
        app: xxx
```

### Step 3: Input Container Image

#### 3.1 Input data exclude Container

In this step, you can know some configs exclude the container config which has more configs.

when you click the **check** button, the container has added in the list

![stateless_form_2_container_item](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_2_container_item.png)

and you can also click **delete icon** or **editor icon** to operate it,


### Step 4: input Volume

![stateless_form_3](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_3.png)

#### 4.1 choose the Volume

{{</ notice >}}

### Step 5: input Advanced Settings

![stateless_form_4](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_4.png)

these are the YAML config keywords which display in the form label

| Advanced Setting            |                                               |

| Maximum Session Sticky Time | sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds |
| Set Node Scheduling Policy  | spec.nodeSelector                             |
| Add Metadata                | label is metadata.annotations                 |

### Step 6: finish

![stateless_finish](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/services_lists_finish.png)

now the Stateless Service has created, you can click it to view more information about it.also you can click`more icon` to operate this service item include edit config and delete.

## Service Internet Access

- ClusterIP: Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType.

- NodePort: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You'll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.

- LoadBalancer: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created.

- ExternalName: Maps the Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record

## Editor Internet Access

Now you know how to create a service in kubesphereï¼Œand you could custom your own service in more configs.
