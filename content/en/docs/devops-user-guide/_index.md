To deploy and manage your CI/CD tasks and related workloads on your Kubernetes clusters, you use the KubeSphere DevOps system. This chapter demonstrates how to manage and work in DevOps projects, including running pipelines, creating credentials, and integrating tools.

As you install the DevOps component, Jenkins is automatically deployed. KubeSphere provides you with a consistent user experience as you can build a pipeline through the Jenkinsfile just as you did before. Besides, KubeSphere features graphical editing panels that visualize the whole process, presenting you with a straightforward view of how your pipeline is running at what stage.
