The built-in Jenkins cannot share the same email configuration with the platform notification system. Thus, you need to configure email server settings for KubeSphere DevOps pipelines separately.

## Prerequisites

- You need to enable [KubeSphere DevOps System](../../../pluggable-components/devops/).
- You need an account granted a role including the authorization of **Clusters Management**. For example, you can log in to the console as `admin` directly or create a new role with the authorization and assign it to an account.

## Set the Email Server

1. Click **Platform** in the top left corner and select **Clusters Management**.

2. If you have enabled the [multi-cluster feature](../../../multicluster-management) with member clusters imported, you can select a specific cluster to view its nodes. If you have not enabled the feature, refer to the next step directly.

3. Go to **Workloads** under **Application Workloads**, and choose the project **kubesphere-devops-system** from the drop-down list. Click the three dots on the right of **ks-jenkins** to edit its YAML.

4. Scroll down to the fields in the image below which you need to specify. Click **Update** when you finish to save changes.

   Once you modify the Email server in the `ks-jenkins` Deployment, it will restart itself. Consequently, the DevOps system will be unavailable for a few minutes. Please make such modification at an appropriate time.
