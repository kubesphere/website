A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline and is checked into source control.  As it stores the entire workflow as code, it underpins the code review and iteration process of a pipeline. For more information, see [the official documentation of Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/).

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a pipeline based on a Jenkinsfile from a GitHub repository. Using the Jenkins pipeline, you deploy an example application to a development environment and a production environment respectively, which is accessible externally.

{{< notice note >}}

Two types of pipelines can be created in KubeSphere: Pipelines created based on a Jenkinsfile in SCM, which is introduced in this tutorial, and [pipelines created through the graphical editing panel](../create-a-pipeline-using-graphical-editing-panel/). The Jenkinsfile in SCM requires an internal Jenkinsfile in Source Control Management (SCM). In other words, the Jenkfinsfile serves as part of SCM. The KubeSphere DevOps system automatically builds a CI/CD Jenkins pipeline based on the existing Jenkinsfile of the code repository. You can define workflows such as `stage` and `step`.

{{</ notice >}} 

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account and a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- You need to [enable the KubeSphere DevOps system](../../../../pluggable-components/devops/).
- You need to create a workspace, a DevOps project, and a user (`project-regular`). This account needs to be invited to the DevOps project with the `operator` role. See [Create Workspaces, Projects, Users and Roles](../../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/) if they are not ready.
- You need to set a CI dedicated node for running pipelines. Refer to [Set a CI Node for Dependency Caching](../../../../devops-user-guide/how-to-use/devops-settings/set-ci-node/).
- You need to install and configure SonarQube. Refer to [Integrate SonarQube into Pipeline](../../../../devops-user-guide/how-to-integrate/sonarqube/). If you skip this part, there is no **SonarQube Analysis** below.

## Jenkins Pipeline Overview

There are eight stages as shown below in this example pipeline.

![Pipeline Overview](https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20190512155453.png#align=left&display=inline&height=1302&originHeight=1302&originWidth=2180&search=&status=done&width=2180)

{{< notice note >}}

- **Stage 1. Checkout SCM**: Check out source code from the GitHub repository.
- **Stage 2. Unit test**: It will not proceed with the next stage until the test is passed.
- **Stage 3. SonarQube analysis**: The SonarQube code quality analysis.
- **Stage 4. Build & push snapshot image**: Build the image based on selected branches in **Strategy Settings**. Push the tag of `SNAPSHOT-$BRANCH_NAME-$BUILD_NUMBER` to Docker Hub, the `$BUILD_NUMBER` of which is the operation serial number in the pipeline's activity list.
- **Stage 5. Push the latest image**: Tag the sonarqube branch as `latest` and push it to Docker Hub.
- **Stage 6. Deploy to dev**: Deploy the sonarqube branch to the development environment. Review is required for this stage.
- **Stage 7. Push with tag**: Generate the tag and release it to GitHub. The tag is pushed to Docker Hub.
- **Stage 8. Deploy to production**: Deploy the released tag to the production environment.

## Hands-on Lab

### Step 1: Create credentials

1. Log in to the KubeSphere console as `project-regular`. Go to your DevOps project and create the following credentials in **Credentials** under **DevOps Project Settings**. For more information about how to create credentials, see [Credential Management](../../../../devops-user-guide/how-to-use/devops-settings/credential-management/).

   {{< notice note >}}

   If there are any special characters such as `@` and `$` in your account or password, they can cause errors as a pipeline runs because they may not be recognized. In this case, you need to encode your account or password on some third-party websites first, such as [urlencoder](https://www.urlencoder.org/). After that, copy and paste the output for your credential information.

   {{</ notice >}} 

   | Credential ID   | Type                | Where to use |
   | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
   | dockerhub-id    | Account Credentials | Docker Hub   |
   | github-id       | Account Credentials | GitHub       |
   | demo-kubeconfig | kubeconfig          | Kubernetes   |

2. You need to create an additional credential (`sonar-token`) for SonarQube, which is used in stage 3 (SonarQube analysis) mentioned above. Refer to [Create SonarQube Token for New Project](../../../../devops-user-guide/how-to-integrate/sonarqube/#create-a-sonarqube-token-for-a-new-project) to enter your SonarQube token in the **Token** field for a credential of the **Access token** type. Click **OK** to finish.

3. You also need to create a GitHub personal access token with the permission as shown in the below image, and then use the generated token to create Account Credentials (for example, `github-token`) for GitHub authentication in your DevOps project. 

   ![github-token-scope](/images/docs/v3.3/devops-user-guide/using-devops/create-a-pipeline-using-a-jenkinsfile/github-token-scope.png)

   {{< notice note >}}

   To create a GitHub personal access token, go to **Settings** of your GitHub account, click **Developer settings**, select **Personal access tokens**, and click **Generate new token**.

   {{</ notice >}}

4. In total, you have five credentials in the list.

### Step 2: Modify the Jenkinsfile in your GitHub repository

1. Log in to GitHub. Fork [devops-maven-sample](https://github.com/kubesphere/devops-maven-sample) from the GitHub repository to your own GitHub account.

2. In your own GitHub repository of **devops-maven-sample**, click the file `Jenkinsfile-online` in the root directory.

3. Click the edit icon on the right to edit environment variables.

   ![jenkins-edit-2](/images/docs/v3.3/devops-user-guide/using-devops/create-a-pipeline-using-a-jenkinsfile/jenkins-edit-2.jpg)

   | Items | Value | Description |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | DOCKER\_CREDENTIAL\_ID | dockerhub-id | The **Name** you set in KubeSphere for your Docker Hub account. |
   | GITHUB\_CREDENTIAL\_ID | github-id | The **Name** you set in KubeSphere for your GitHub account. It is used to push tags to your GitHub repository. |
   | KUBECONFIG\_CREDENTIAL\_ID | demo-kubeconfig | The **Name** you set in KubeSphere for your kubeconfig. It is used to access a running Kubernetes cluster. |
   | REGISTRY | docker.io | It defaults to `docker.io`, serving as the address of pushing images. |
   | DOCKERHUB\_NAMESPACE | your-dockerhub-account | Replace it with your Docker Hub's account name. It can be the Organization name under the account. |
   | GITHUB\_ACCOUNT | your-github-account | Replace it with your GitHub account name. For example, your GitHub account name is `kubesphere` if your GitHub address is  `https://github.com/kubesphere/`. It can also be the account's Organization name. |
   | APP\_NAME | devops-maven-sample | The application name. |
   | SONAR\_CREDENTIAL\_ID | sonar-token | The **Name** you set in KubeSphere for the SonarQube token. It is used for code quality test. |

   {{< notice note >}}
   
   The command parameter `-o` of Jenkinsfile's `mvn` indicates that the offline mode is enabled. Relevant dependencies have already been downloaded in this tutorial to save time and to adapt to network interference in certain environments. The offline mode is on by default.
   
   {{</ notice >}} 

4. After you edit the environmental variables, click **Commit changes** at the bottom of the page, which updates the file in the SonarQube branch.

### Step 3: Create projects

You need to create two projects, such as `kubesphere-sample-dev` and `kubesphere-sample-prod`, which represent the development environment and the production environment respectively. Related Deployments and Services of the app will be created automatically in these two projects once the pipeline runs successfully.

{{< notice note >}}

The account `project-admin` needs to be created in advance since it is the reviewer of the CI/CD Pipeline. See [Create Workspaces, Projects, Users and Roles](../../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/) for more information.

{{</ notice >}}

1. Use the account `project-admin` to log in to KubeSphere. In the same workspace where you create the DevOps project, create two projects as below. Make sure you invite `project-regular` to these two projects with the role of `operator`.

   | Project Name           | Alias                   |
   | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
   | kubesphere-sample-dev  | development environment |
   | kubesphere-sample-prod | production environment  |

2. After those projects are created, they will be listed in the project list.

### Step 4: Create a pipeline

1. Log out of KubeSphere and log back in as `project-regular`. Go to the DevOps project `demo-devops` and click **Create**.

2. Provide the basic information in the displayed dialog box. Name it `jenkinsfile-in-scm` and specify a code repository under **Code Repository**.

3. In the **GitHub** tab, select **github-token** from the drop-down list under **Credential**, and then click **OK** to select your repository.

4. Choose your GitHub account. All the repositories related to this token will be listed on the right. Select **devops-maven-sample** and click **Select**. Click **Next** to continue.

5. In **Advanced Settings**, select the checkbox next to **Delete outdated branches**. In this tutorial, you can use the default value of **Branch Retention Period (days)** and **Maximum Branches**.

   Delete outdated branches means that you will discard the branch record all together. The branch record includes console output, archived artifacts and other relevant metadata of specific branches. Fewer branches mean that you can save the disk space that Jenkins is using. KubeSphere provides two options to determine when old branches are discarded:

   - Branch Retention Period (days). Branches that exceed the retention period are deleted. 

   - Maximum Branches. The earliest branch is deleted when the number of branches exceeds the maximum number.

   {{< notice note >}}

   **Branch Retention Period (days)** and **Maximum Branches** apply to branches at the same time. As long as a branch meets the condition of either field, it is deleted. For example, if you specify 2 as the retention period and 3 as the maximum number of branches, any branch that exceed either number is deleted. KubeSphere prepopulates these two fields with 7 and 5 by default respectively.

   {{</ notice >}} 

6. In **Strategy Settings**, KubeSphere offers four strategies by default. You can delete **Discover PRs from Forks** as this strategy will not be used in this example. You do not need to change the setting and can use the default value directly.

   As a Jenkins pipeline runs, the Pull Request (PR) submitted by developers will also be regarded as a separate branch.

   **Discover Branches**

   - **Exclude branches filed as PRs**. The source branch is not scanned such as the origin's master branch. These branches need to be merged.
   - **Include only branches filed as PRs**. Only scan the PR branch.
   - **Include all branches**. Pull all the branches from the repository origin.

   **Discover PRs from Origin**

   - **Pull the code with the PR merged**. A pipeline is created and runs based on the source code after the PR is merged into the target branch.
   - **Pull the code at the point of the PR**. A pipeline is created and runs based on the source code of the PR itself.
   - **Create two pipelines respectively**. KubeSphere creates two pipelines, one based on the source code after the PR is merged into the target branch, and the other based on the source code of the PR itself.

   {{< notice note >}}

   You have to choose GitHub as your code repository to enable the settings of **Strategy Settings** here.

   {{</ notice >}}

7. Scroll down to **Script Path**. The field specifies the Jenkinsfile path in the code repository. It indicates the repository's root directory. If the file location changes, the script path also needs to be changed. Change it to `Jenkinsfile-online`, which is the file name of Jenkinsfile in the example repository located in the root directory.

8. In **Scan Trigger**, select **Scan periodically** and set the interval to **5 minutes**. Click **Create** to finish.

   {{< notice note >}}

   You can set a specific interval to allow pipelines to scan remote repositories, so that any code updates or new PRs can be detected based on the strategy you set in **Strategy Settings**.

   {{</ notice >}}

### Step 5: Run a pipeline

1. After a pipeline is created, click its name to go to its details page.

   {{< notice note >}}

   - You can click <img src="/images/docs/v3.3/common-icons/three-dots.png" width="15" /> on the right side of the pipeline and then select **Copy** to create a copy of it. If you need to concurrently run multiple pipelines that don't contain multiple branches, you can select all of these pipelines and then click **Run** to run them in a batch.
   - The pipeline details page shows **Sync Status**. It reflects the synchronization result between KubeSphere and Jenkins, and you can see the **Successful** icon if the synchronization is successful.  

   {{</ notice >}} 

2. Under **Run Records**, three branches are being scanned. Click **Run** on the right and the pipeline runs based on the behavioral strategy you set. Select **sonarqube** from the drop-down list and add a tag number such as `v0.0.2`. Click **OK** to trigger a new activity.

   {{< notice note >}} 

   - If you do not see any run records on this page, you need to refresh your browser manually or click **Scan Repository** from the drop-down menu (the **More** button).
   - The tag name is used to generate releases and images with the tag in GitHub and Docker Hub. An existing tag name cannot be used again for the field `TAG_NAME`. Otherwise, the pipeline will not be running successfully.

   {{</ notice >}}

3. Wait for a while, and you can see some activities stop and some fail. Click the first one to view details.

   {{< notice note >}}

   Activity failures may be caused by different factors. In this example, only the Jenkinsfile of the branch sonarqube is changed as you edit the environment variables in it in the steps above. On the contrary, these variables in the dependency and master branch remain changed (namely, wrong GitHub and Docker Hub account), resulting in the failure. You can click it and inspect its logs to see details. Other reasons for failures may be network issues, incorrect coding in the Jenkinsfile and so on.

   {{</ notice >}} 

4. The pipeline pauses at the stage `deploy to dev`. You need to click **Proceed** manually. Note that the pipeline will be reviewed three times as `deploy to dev`, `push with tag`, and `deploy to production` are defined in the Jenkinsfile respectively.

   In a development or production environment, it requires someone who has higher authority (for example, release manager) to review the pipeline, images, as well as the code analysis result. They have the authority to determine whether the pipeline can go to the next stage. In the Jenkinsfile, you use the section `input` to specify who reviews the pipeline. If you want to specify a user (for example, `project-admin`) to review it, you can add a field in the Jenkinsfile. If there are multiple users, you need to use commas to separate them as follows:

   ```groovy
   ···
   input(id: 'release-image-with-tag', message: 'release image with tag?', submitter: 'project-admin,project-admin1')
   ···
   ```
   
   {{< notice note >}}
   
   In KubeSphere 3.3.0, the account that can run a pipeline will be able to continue or terminate the pipeline if there is no reviewer specified. Pipeline creators, accounts with the role of `admin` in the project, or the account you specify will be able to continue or terminate the pipeline.
   
   {{</ notice >}}

### Step 6: Check pipeline status

1. In **Task Status**, you can see how a pipeline is running. Please note that the pipeline will keep initializing for several minutes after it is just created. There are eight stages in the sample pipeline and they have been defined separately in [Jenkinsfile-online](https://github.com/kubesphere/devops-maven-sample/blob/sonarqube/Jenkinsfile-online).

2. Check the pipeline running logs by clicking **View Logs** in the upper-right corner. You can see the dynamic log output of the pipeline, including any errors that may stop the pipeline from running. For each stage, you click it to inspect logs, which can be downloaded to your local machine for further analysis.

### Step 7: Verify results

1. Once you successfully executed the pipeline, click **Code Check** to check the results through SonarQube as follows.

2. The Docker image built through the pipeline has also been successfully pushed to Docker Hub, as it is defined in the Jenkinsfile. In Docker Hub, you will find the image with the tag `v0.0.2` that is specified before the pipeline runs.

3. At the same time, a new tag and a new release have been generated in GitHub.

4. The sample application will be deployed to `kubesphere-sample-dev` and `kubesphere-sample-prod` with corresponding Deployments and Services created. Go to these two projects and here are the expected result:

   | Environment | URL | Namespace | Deployment | Service |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | Development | `http://{$NodeIP}:{$30861}` | kubesphere-sample-dev | ks-sample-dev | ks-sample-dev |
   | Production | `http://{$NodeIP}:{$30961}` | kubesphere-sample-prod | ks-sample | ks-sample |

   {{< notice note >}}

   You may need to open the port in your security groups so that you can access the app with the URL.

   {{</ notice >}} 

### Step 8: Access the example Service

1. To access the Service, log in to KubeSphere as `admin` to use the **kubectl** from **Toolbox**. Go to the project `kubesphere-sample-dev`, and click `ks-sample-dev` in **Services** under **Application Workloads**. Obtain the endpoint displayed on the details page to access the Service.

2. Use the **kubectl** from **Toolbox** in the lower-right corner by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   curl 10.233.120.230:8080
   ```

3. Expected output:

   ```bash
   Really appreciate your star, that's the power of our life.
   ```

   {{< notice note >}} 

   Use `curl` endpoints or {$Virtual IP}:{$Port} or {$Node IP}:{$NodePort} 

   {{</ notice >}} 

4. Similarly, you can test the Service in the project `kubesphere-sample-prod` and you will see the same result.

   ```bash
   $ curl 10.233.120.236:8080
   Really appreciate your star, that's the power of our life.
   ```
