KubeSphere has decoupled some core feature components since v2.1.0. These components are designed to be pluggable which means you can enable them either before or after installation. By default, KubeSphere will be deployed with a minimal installation if you do not enable them.

Different pluggable components are deployed in different namespaces. You can enable any of them based on your needs. It is highly recommended that you install these pluggable components to discover the full-stack features and capabilities provided by KubeSphere.

For more information about how to enable each component, see respective tutorials in this chapter.

## Resource Requirements

Before you enable pluggable components, make sure you have enough resources in your environment based on the tables below. Otherwise, components may crash due to a lack of resources.

The following request and limit of CPU and memory resources are required by a single replica.

{{< notice note >}}

The KubeSphere monitoring system is not a pluggable component. It is installed by default. The resource request and limit of it are also listed on this page for your reference as it is closely related to other components such as logging.
