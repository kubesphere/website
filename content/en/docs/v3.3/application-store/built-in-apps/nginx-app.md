[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) is an open-source software application for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more.

This tutorial walks you through an example of deploying NGINX from the App Store of KubeSphere.

## Prerequisites

- Please make sure you [enable the OpenPitrix system](../../../pluggable-components/app-store/).
- You need to create a workspace, a project, and a user account (`project-regular`) for this tutorial. The account needs to be a platform regular user and to be invited as the project operator with the `operator` role. In this tutorial, you log in as `project-regular` and work in the project `demo-project` in the workspace `demo-workspace`. For more information, see [Create Workspaces, Projects, Users and Roles](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/).

## Hands-on Lab

### Step 1: Deploy NGINX from the App Store

1. On the **Overview** page of the project `demo-project`, click **App Store** in the upper-left corner.

2. Find NGINX and click **Install** on the **App Information** page.

3. Set a name and select an app version. Make sure NGINX is deployed in `demo-project` and click **Next**.

4. In **App Settings**, specify the number of replicas to deploy for the app and enable Ingress based on your needs. When you finish, click **Install**.

   To specify more values for NGINX, use the toggle switch to see the appâ€™s manifest in YAML format and edit its configurations.

5. Wait until NGINX is up and running.

### Step 2: Access NGINX

To access NGINX outside the cluster, you need to expose the app through a NodePort first.

1. Go to **Services** and click the service name of NGINX.

2. On the service details page, click **More** and select **Edit External Access** from the drop-down list.

3. Select **NodePort** for **Access Method** and click **OK**. For more information, see [Project Gateway](../../../project-administration/project-gateway/).

4. Under **Ports**, you can see the port is exposed.

5. Access NGINX through `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.

   You may need to open the port in your security groups and configure related port forwarding rules depending on where your Kubernetes cluster is deployed.
