KubeSphere automatically creates a default user (`admin/P@88w0rd`) when it is installed. A user cannot be used for login if the status is not **Active** or you use an incorrect password.

Here are some of the frequently asked questions about user login failure.

## User Not Active

You may see an image below when the login fails. To find out the reason and solve the issue, perform the following steps:

![account-not-active](/images/docs/v3.3/faq/access-control-and-account-management/cannot-login/account-not-active.png)

1. Execute the following command to check the status of the user.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get users
   NAME         EMAIL                    STATUS
   admin        admin@kubesphere.io      Active
   ```

2. Verify that `ks-controller-manager` is running and check if exceptions are contained in logs:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n kubesphere-system logs -l app=ks-controller-manager
   ```

Here are some possible reasons for this issue.

### Admission webhooks malfunction in Kubernetes 1.19

Kubernetes 1.19 uses Golang 1.15 in coding, requiring the certificate for admission webhooks to be updated. This causes the failure of `ks-controller` admission webhook.

Related error logs:

```bash
Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validating-user.kubesphere.io": Post "https://ks-controller-manager.kubesphere-system.svc:443/validate-email-iam-kubesphere-io-v1alpha2-user?timeout=30s": x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0
```

For more information about the issue and solution, see this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/2928).

### ks-controller-manager malfunctions

`ks-controller-manager` relies on two stateful Services: OpenLDAP and Jenkins. When OpenLDAP or Jenkins goes down, `ks-controller-manager` will be in the status of `reconcile`.

Execute the following commands to verify that OpenLDAP and Jenkins are running normally. 

```
kubectl -n kubesphere-devops-system get po | grep -v Running
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get po | grep -v Running
kubectl -n kubesphere-system logs -l app=openldap
```

Related error logs:

```bash
failed to connect to ldap service, please check ldap status, error: factory is not able to fill the pool: LDAP Result Code 200 \"Network Error\": dial tcp: lookup openldap.kubesphere-system.svc on 169.254.25.10:53: no such host
```

```bash
Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook “validating-user.kubesphere.io”: Post https://ks-controller-manager.kubesphere-system.svc:443/validate-email-iam-kubesphere-io-v1alpha2-user?timeout=4s: context deadline exceeded
```

#### Solution

You need to restore OpenLDAP and Jenkins with good network connection, and then restart `ks-controller-manager`.

```
kubectl -n kubesphere-system rollout restart deploy ks-controller-manager
```

### Wrong code branch used

If you used the incorrect version of ks-installer, the versions of different components would not match after the installation. Execute the following commands to check version consistency. Note that the correct image tag is `v3.3.0`.

```
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get deploy ks-installer -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get deploy ks-apiserver -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get deploy ks-controller-manager -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
```

## Wrong Username or Password

![incorrect-password](/images/docs/v3.3/faq/access-control-and-account-management/cannot-login/wrong-password.png)

Run the following command to verify that the username and the password are correct.

```
curl -u <USERNAME>:<PASSWORD> "http://`kubectl -n kubesphere-system get svc ks-apiserver -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'`/api/v1/nodes"
```

### Redis failure

`ks-console` and `ks-apiserver` use Redis to share data across multiple copies. Use the following commands to verify that Redis is running normally.

```
kubectl -n kubesphere-system logs -l app=ks-console
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get po | grep -v Running
# High Availability
kubectl -n kubesphere-system  exec -it redis-ha-server-0 redis-cli info replication
kubectl -n kubesphere-system  exec -it redis-ha-server-0 -- sh -c 'for i in `seq 0 2`; do nc -vz redis-ha-server-$i.redis-ha.kubesphere-system.svc 6379; done'
kubectl -n kubesphere-system logs -l app=redis-ha-haproxy
kubectl -n kubesphere-system logs -l app=redis-ha
# Single Replica 
kubectl -n kubesphere-system logs -l app=redis
```

```

#### Solution

You need to restore Redis and make sure it is running normally with good network connection between Pods. After that, restart `ks-console` to synchronize the data across copies.

```
kubectl -n kubesphere-system rollout restart deploy ks-console
```
