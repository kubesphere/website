KubeSphere uses [Kubernetes requests and limits](https://kubesphere.io/blogs/understand-requests-and-limits-in-kubernetes/) to control resource (for example, CPU and memory) usage in a project, also known as [resource quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) in Kubernetes. Requests make sure a project can get the resources it needs as they are specifically guaranteed and reserved. On the contrary, limits ensure that a project can never use resources above a certain value.

Besides CPU and memory, you can also set resource quotas for other objects separately such as Pods, [Deployments](../../project-user-guide/application-workloads/deployments/), [Jobs](../../project-user-guide/application-workloads/jobs/), [Services](../../project-user-guide/application-workloads/services/), and [ConfigMaps](../../project-user-guide/configuration/configmaps/) in a project.

This tutorial demonstrates how to configure quotas for a project.

## Prerequisites

You have an available workspace, a project and a user (`ws-admin`). The user must have the `admin` role at the workspace level. For more information, see [Create Workspaces, Projects, Users and Roles](../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/).

{{< notice note >}}

If you use the user `project-admin` (a user of the `admin` role at the project level), you can set project quotas as well for a new project (i.e. its quotas remain unset). However, `project-admin` cannot change project quotas once they are set. Generally, it is the responsibility of `ws-admin` to set limits and requests for a project. `project-admin` is responsible for [setting limit ranges](../../project-administration/container-limit-ranges/) for containers in a project.

## Set Project Quotas

1. Log in to the console as `ws-admin` and go to a project. On the **Overview** page, you can see project quotas remain unset if the project is newly created. Click **Edit Quotas** to configure quotas.

2. In the displayed dialog box, you can see that KubeSphere does not set any requests or limits for a project by default. To set 
limits to control CPU and memory resources, use the slider to move to a desired value or enter numbers directly. Leaving a field blank means you do not set any requests or limits. 

   {{< notice note >}}

   The limit can never be lower than the request.

3. To set quotas for other resources, click **Add** under **Project Resource Quotas**, and then select a resource or enter a recource name and set a quota.

4. Click **OK** to finish setting quotas.

5. Go to **Basic Information** in **Project Settings**, and you can see all resource quotas for the project.

6. To change project quotas, click **Edit Project** on the **Basic Information** page and select **Edit Project Quotas**.

   {{< notice note >}}

   For [a multi-cluster project](../../project-administration/project-and-multicluster-project/#multi-cluster-projects), the option **Edit Project Quotas** does not display in the **Manage Project** drop-down menu. To set quotas for a multi-cluster project, go to **Projects Quotas** under **Project Settings** and click **Edit Quotas**. Note that as a multi-cluster project runs across clusters, you can set resource quotas on different clusters separately.

7. Change project quotas in the dialog that appears and click **OK**.
