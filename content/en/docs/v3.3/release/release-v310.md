- Upgraded the Prometheus client_golang version dependency to v1.5.1 and Prometheus version dependency to v1.8.2. ([#3097](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/pull/3097))
- Refactored OpenPitrix based on CRDs and fixed some issues caused by the original architecture. ([#3036](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/3036), [#3001](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/3001), [#2995](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/2995), [#2981](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/2981), [#2954](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/2954), [#2951](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/2951), [#2783](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/2783), [#2713](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/2713), [#2700](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/2700) and [#1903](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/1903))
- Refactored the previous alerting system with old alerting rules deprecated and removed its dependency on MySQL, Redis, etcd and other components. The new alerting system works based on Thanos Ruler and the build-in rules of Prometheus. Old alerting rules in KubeSphere v3.0.0 will be automatically changed to new alerting rules in KubeSphere v3.1.0 after upgrading.
- Refactored the notification system and removed its dependency on MySQL, Redis, etcd and other components. Notification channels are now configured for the entire cluster based on [Notification Manager](https://github.com/kubesphere/notification-manager/) in CRDs. In a multi-cluster architecture, if a notification channel is set for the Host cluster, it works for all Member Clusters.

## Deprecated or Removed Features

- The legacy alerting and notification system dependent on MySQL, Redis, etcd and other components is replaced by the new alerting and notification function.
