In KubeSphere, you set a cluster's configurations and configure its features using the interactive web console or the built-in native command-line tool kubectl. As a cluster administrator, you are responsible for a series of tasks, including cordoning and adding labels to nodes, controlling cluster visibility, monitoring cluster status, setting cluster-wide alerting and notification rules, as well as configuring storage and log collection solutions.
