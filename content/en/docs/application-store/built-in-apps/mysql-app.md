[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), which uses the most commonly used database management language - Structured Query Language (SQL) for database management. It provides a fully managed database service to deploy cloud-native applications using the worldâ€™s most popular open-source database.

This tutorial walks you through an example of deploying MySQL from the App Store of KubeSphere.

## Prerequisites

- Please make sure you [enable the OpenPitrix system](https://kubesphere.io/docs/pluggable-components/app-store/).
- You need to create a workspace, a project, and a user account for this tutorial. The account needs to be a platform regular user and to be invited as the project operator with the `operator` role. In this tutorial, you log in as `project-regular` and work in the project `demo-project` in the workspace `demo-workspace`. For more information, see [Create Workspaces, Projects, Accounts and Roles](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/).

## Hands-on Lab

### Step 1: Deploy MySQL from the App Store

1. On the **Overview** page of the project `demo-project`, click **App Store** in the top left corner.

2. Find MySQL and click **Deploy** on the **App Info** page.

   ![click-deploy](/images/docs/appstore/built-in-apps/mysql-app/click-deploy.jpg)

3. Set a name and select an app version. Make sure MySQL is deployed in `demo-project` and click **Next**.

4. In **App Config**, uncomment the `mysqlRootPassword` field and customize the password. Click **Deploy** to continue.

5. Wait until MySQL is up and running.

### Step 2: Access the MySQL Terminal

1. Go to **Workloads** and click the service name of MySQL.

2. Under **Pods**, expand the menu to see container details, and then click the **Terminal** icon.

3. In the terminal, execute `mysql -uroot -ptesting` to log in to MySQL as the root user.

### Step 3: Access the MySQL Database outside the Cluster

To access MySQL outside the cluster, you need to expose the app through NodePort first.

1. Go to **Services** and click the service name of MySQL.

   ![mysql-service](/images/docs/appstore/built-in-apps/mysql-app/mysql-service.jpg)

2. Click **More** and select **Edit Internet Access** from the drop-down menu.

   ![edit-internet-access](/images/docs/appstore/built-in-apps/mysql-app/edit-internet-access.jpg)

3. Select **NodePort** for **Access Method** and click **OK**. For more information, see [Project Gateway](../../../project-administration/project-gateway/).

   ![nodeport-mysql](/images/docs/appstore/built-in-apps/mysql-app/nodeport-mysql.jpg)

4. Under **Service Ports**, you can see the port is exposed. The port and public IP will be used in the next step to access the MySQL database.

   ![mysql-port-number](/images/docs/appstore/built-in-apps/mysql-app/mysql-port-number.jpg)

5. To access your MySQL database, you need to use the MySQL client or install a third-party application such as SQLPro Studio for the connection. The following example demonstrates how to access the MySQL database through SQLPro Studio.

   {{< notice note >}}

   You may need to open the port in your security groups and configure related port forwarding rules depending on your where your Kubernetes cluster is deployed.
