[Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/index.html) software powers numerous large-scale, mission-critical web applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations.
This tutorial walks you through an example of how to deploy Tomcat on KubeSphere.

## Prerequisites

- Please make sure you [enable the OpenPitrix system](https://kubesphere.io/docs/pluggable-components/app-store/). Tomcat will be deployed from the App Store.
- You need to create a workspace, a project, and a user account for this tutorial.  The account needs to be a platform regular user and to be invited as the project operator with the `operator` role. In this tutorial, you log in as `project-operator` and work in the project `test-project` in the workspace `test-workspace`.

## Hands-on Lab
