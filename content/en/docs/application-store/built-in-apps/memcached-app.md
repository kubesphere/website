[Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is designed for large data caches. Its API is available for most popular languages. This guide will show you one-click deployment for Memcached in Kubenetes .

## Prerequisites

- You have enabled [KubeSphere App Store](../../pluggable-components/app-store)
- You have completed the tutorial in [Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role](../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/). Now switch to use `project-regular` account to log in and enter into `demo-peoject`.

## Hands-on Lab

6. Because Memcached service type is headless, we should connect it inside cluster with pod IP got previously and default port `11211`.
