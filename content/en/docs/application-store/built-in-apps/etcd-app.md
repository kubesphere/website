# Objective

This tutorial shows you how to quickly deploy an [etcd](https://etcd.io) application using templates from KubeSphere App Store (Powered by OpenPitrix). The demonstration includes importing application repository, sharing and deploying apps within a workspace.

# Prerequisites

- You have enabled [KubeSphere Application Store](/docs/pluggable-components/app-store/)
- You have completed the tutorial [Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role](/docs/quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/). The account needs to be a platform regular user and to be invited as the project operator with the `operator` role. In this tutorial, we'll work in the project `project-apps` of the workspace `ws-apps`.

# Hands-on Lab

## Step 1: Browse Apps

1.1. Sign in KubeSphere as a workspace regular account (`ws-apps-regular` for this guide), then enter into project `project-apps`.

1.2. Click **Application Workloads â†’ Applications**, click **Deploy New Application**.

1.3. Choose **From App Store**. Click `etcd`.

## Step 2: Deploy etcd Application

2.1. Click **Deploy** at the top right, customize app name if needed, and then click **Next**.

2.2. Customize the persistent volume size, and then click **Deploy**.

2.3. Wait for a few minutes, then you will see the application showing `active` in the application list.

## Step 3: Access the etcd Service

3.1. We can interact with etcd by etcdctl CLI tool within the etcd pod. Click the deployed app and enter the terminal.

![etcd terminal](/images/docs/appstore/etcd/access-etcd-terminal.png)

3.2. Write and read some data.

```
etcdctl set /name kubesphere
etcdctl get /name
```

3.3. For clients within the KubeSphere cluster, etcd service can be accessed through `<app name>.<project name>.svc.<K8s domain>:2379` (`etcd-ca9w6t.project-apps.svc.cluster.local:2379` for this guide).
