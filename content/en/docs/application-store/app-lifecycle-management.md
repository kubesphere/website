KubeSphere integrates open-source project [OpenPitrix](https://github.com/openpitrix/openpitrix) to set up the App Store which provide the full lifecycle of application management. App Store supports two kinds of application deployment as follows:

> - **Application template** provides a way for developers and ISVs to share applications with users in a workspace. It also supports importing third-party application repositories within workspace.
> - **Composing application** means users can quickly compose multiple microservices into a complete application through the one-stop console.

## Objective

In this tutorial, we will walk you through how to use [EMQ X](https://www.emqx.io/) as a demo application to demonstrate the **global application store** and **application lifecycle management** including upload / submit / review / test / release / upgrade / delete application templates.

## Prerequisites

- You need to install [App Store (OpenPitrix)](../../pluggable-components/app-store).
- You need to create a workspace and a project, see [Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role](../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/).

## Hands-on Lab

### Step 1: Create Customized Role and Account

In this step, we will create two accounts, i.e., `isv` for ISVs and `reviewer` for app technical reviewers.

1.1. First of all, we need to create a role for app reviewers. Log in KubeSphere console with the account `admin`, go to **Platform → Access Control → Account Roles**, then click **Create** and name it `app-review`, choose **App Templates Management** and **App Templates View**  in the authorization settings list, then click **Create**.

1.2. Create an account `reviewer`, and grant the role of **app-review** to it.

1.3. Similarly, create an account `isv`, and grant the role of **platform-regular** to it.

![Create Accounts](/images/application-templates/create-accounts.png)

1.4. Invite the accounts that we created above to an existing workspace such as `demo-workspace`, and grant them the role of `workspace-admin`.

### Step 2: Upload and Submit Application

2.1. Log in KubeSphere with `isv`, enter the workspace. We are going to upload the EMQ X app to this workspace. First please download [EMQ X chart v1.0.0](https://github.com/kubesphere/tutorial/raw/master/tutorial%205%20-%20app-store/emqx-v1.0.0-rc.1.tgz) and click **Upload Template** by choosing **App Templates**.

> Note we are going to upload a newer version of EMQ X to demo the upgrade feature later on.

![App Templates](/images/application-templates/app-templates.png)

2.2. Click **Upload**, then click **Upload Helm Chart Package** to upload the chart.

![Upload Template](/images/application-templates/upload-templates.png)

2.3. Click **OK**. Now download [EMQ Icon](https://github.com/kubesphere/tutorial/raw/master/tutorial%205%20-%20app-store/emqx-logo.png) and click **Upload icon** to upload App logo. Click **OK** when you are done.

![EMQ Template](/images/application-templates/upload-icons.png)

2.4. At this point, you will be able to see the status displays `draft`, which means this app is under developing. The uploaded app is visible for all members in the same workspace.

![Template List](/images/application-templates/app-templates-draft.png)

2.5. Enter app template detailed page by clicking on EMQ X from the list. You can edit the basic information of this app by clicking **Edit Info**.

![Edit Template](/images/application-templates/edit-template.png)

2.6. You can customize the app's basic information by filling in the table as the following screenshot.

![Customize Template](/images/application-templates/edit-app-info.png)

2.7. Save your changes, then you can test this application by deploying to Kubernetes. Click on the **Test Deploy** button.

![Save Template](/images/application-templates/test-deploy.png)

2.8. Select cluster and project that you want to deploy into, check app config then click **Deploy**.

![Deploy Template](/images/application-templates/select-deploy-location.png)

![Template Instance](/images/application-templates/app-deploy.png)

2.9. Wait for a few minutes, then switch to the tab **Deployed Instances**. You will find EMQ X App has been deployed successfully.

![Template Instance](/images/application-templates/deploy-instance.png)

2.10. At this point, you can click `Submit Review` to submit this application to `reviewer`.

![Submit Template](/images/application-templates/submit-review.png)

2.11. As shown in the following graph, the app status has been changed to `Submitted`. Now app reviewer can review it.

![Template Status](/images/application-templates/submitted.png)

### Step 3: Review Application

3.1. Log out, then use `reviewer` account to log in KubeSphere. Navigate to **Platform → App Store Management → App Review**.

![Review List](/images/application-templates/app-review.png)

3.2. Click **Review** by clicking the vertical three dots at the end of app item in the list, then you start to review the app's basic information, introduction, chart file and updated logs from the pop-up windows.

![EMQ Info](/images/application-templates/review.png)

3.3. It is the reviewer's responsibility to judge if the app satisfies the criteria of the Global App Store or not, if yes, then click `Pass`; otherwise, `Reject` it.

### Step 4: Release Application to Store

4.1. Log out and switch to use `isv` to log in KubeSphere. Now `isv` can release the EMQ X application to the global application store which means all users in this platform can find and deploy this application.

4.2. Enter the demo workspace and navigate to the EMQ X app from the template list. Enter the detailed page and expand the version list, then click **Release to Store**, choose **OK** in the pop-up windows.

![Release EMQ](/images/application-templates/release-app.png)

4.3. At this point, EMQ X has been released to application store.

![Audit Records](/images/application-templates/aduit-records.png)

4.4. Go to **App Store** in the top menu, you will see the app in the list.

![EMQ on Store](/images/application-templates/emqx.png)

4.5. At this point, we can use any role of users to access EMQ X application. Click into the application detailed page to go through its basic information. You can click **Deploy** button to deploy the application to Kubernetes.

![Deploy EMQ](/images/application-templates/deploy-emqx.png)

### Step 5: Create Application Category

Depending on the business needs, `Reviewer` can create multiple categories for different types of applications. It is similar as tag and can be used in application store to filter applications, e.g. Big data, Middleware, IoT, etc.

As for EMQ X application, we can create a category and name it `IOT`. First switch back to the user `Reviewer`, go to **Platform → App  Store Management → App Categories**

![Create Category](/images/application-templates/iot-category.png)

Then click **Uncategorized** and find EMQ X, change its category to `IOT` and save it.

> Note usually reviewer should create necessary categories in advance according to the requirements of the store. Then ISVs categorize their applications as appropriate before submitting for review.

### Step 6: Add New Version

6.1. KubeSphere supports adding new versions of existing applications for users to quickly upgrade. Let's continue to use `isv` account and enter the EMQ X template page in the workspace.

![Create New Version](/images/application-templates/emqx-active.png)

6.2. Download [EMQ X v4.0.2](https://github.com/kubesphere/tutorial/raw/master/tutorial%205%20-%20app-store/emqx-v4.0.2.tgz), then click on the **New Version** on the right, upload the package that you just downloaded.

![Upload New Version](/images/application-templates/emqx-new-version.png)

6.3. Click **OK** when you upload successfully.

![New Version Info](/images/application-templates/upload-emqx-new-version.png)

6.4. At this point, you can test the new version and submit it to `Reviewer`. This process is similar to the one for the first version.

![Submit New Version](/images/application-templates/upload-emqx-new-version.png)

6.5. After you submit the new version, the rest of process regarding review and release are also similar to the first version that we demonstrated above.

### Step 7: Upgrade

After the new version has been released to application store, all users can upgrade from this application.
