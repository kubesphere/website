## Overview

[KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io) is a **distributed operating system managing cloud-native applications** with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as its kernel. It provides a plug-and-play architecture for the seamless integration of third-party applications to boost its ecosystem.

KubeSphere also represents a multi-tenant enterprise-grade container platform with full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly wizard web UI, helping enterprises to build out a robust and feature-rich platform. It boasts the most common functionalities needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategies, such as **Kubernetes resource management**, **DevOps (CI/CD)**, **application lifecycle management**, **monitoring**, **logging**, **service mesh**, **multi-tenancy**, **alerting and notification**, **auditing**, **storage and networking**, **autoscaling**, **access control**, **GPU support**, **multi-cluster deployment and management**, **network policy**, **registry management**, and **security management**.

The KubeSphere team developed [KubeKey](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey), an open-source brand-new installer, to help enterprises quickly set up a Kubernetes cluster on public clouds or data centers. Users have the option to install Kubernetes only or install both KubeSphere and Kubernetes. KubeKey provides users with different installation options such as all-in-one installation and multi-node installation. It is also an efficient tool to install cloud-native add-ons, and upgrade and scale your Kubernetes cluster.

## O&M Friendly

KubeSphere hides the details of underlying infrastructure for users and helps enterprises modernize, migrate, deploy and manage existing and containerized apps seamlessly across a variety of infrastructure types. This is how KubeSphere empowers developers and Ops teams to focus on application development and accelerate DevOps automated workflows and delivery processes with enterprise-level observability and troubleshooting, unified monitoring and logging, centralized storage and networking management, easy-to-use CI/CD pipelines, and so on.

## Run KubeSphere Everywhere

As a lightweight platform, KubeSphere has become more friendly to different cloud ecosystems as it does not change Kubernetes itself at all. In other words, KubeSphere can be deployed **on any existing version-compatible Kubernetes cluster on any infrastructure** including virtual machine, bare metal, on-premises, public cloud and hybrid cloud.

KubeSphere users have the choice of installing KubeSphere on clouds and container platforms, such as Alibaba Cloud, AWS, QingCloud, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud and Rancher, and even importing and managing their existing Kubernetes clusters.

The seamless integration of KubeSphere into existing Kubernetes platforms means that the business of users will not be affected, without any modification to their current resources or assets. For more information, see [Installing on Linux](../../installing-on-linux/) and [Installing on Kubernetes](../../installing-on-kubernetes/).

## Open Source

With the open-source model, the KubeSphere community advances development in an open way. KubeSphere is **100% open source** and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/) where you can find all the source code, documents and discussions. It has been widely installed and used in development, testing and production environments, and a large number of services are running smoothly in KubeSphere. For more information about all major open-source projects, see [Open Source Projects](../../../projects/).

## Landscape

KubeSphere is a member of CNCF and a [Kubernetes Conformance Certified platform](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/#logos), further enriching [CNCF CLOUD NATIVE Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/landscape=observability-and-analysis&license=apache-license-2-0).
