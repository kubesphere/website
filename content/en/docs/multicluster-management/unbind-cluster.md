This tutorial demonstrates how to unbind a cluster from the central control plane of KubeSphere.

## Prerequisites

- You have enabled multi-cluster management.
- You need an account granted a role including the authorization of **Clusters Management**. For example, you can log in to the console as `admin` directly or create a new role with the authorization and assign it to an account.

## Unbind a Cluster

1. Click **Platform** in the top left corner and select **Clusters Management**.

2. On the **Clusters Management** page, click the cluster that you want to remove from the central control plane.

3. Go to **Basic Info** under **Cluster Settings**, check **I confirm I want to unbind the cluster** and click **Unbind**.

   {{< notice note >}}

   After you unbind the cluster, you cannot manage it from the control plane while Kubernetes resources on the cluster will not be deleted.

## Unbind an Unhealthy Cluster

On some occasions, you cannot unbind a cluster by following the steps above. For example, you import a cluster with the wrong credentials and you cannot access **Cluster Settings**. In this case, execute the following command to unbind an unhealthy cluster:

```bash
kubectl delete <cluster name>
```
