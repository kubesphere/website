## Prerequisites

You have already installed at least two KubeSphere clusters. Please refer to [Installing on Linux](../../../installing-on-linux) or [Installing on Kubernetes](../../../installing-on-kubernetes) if they are not ready yet.

{{< notice note >}}
Multi-cluster management requires Kubesphere to be installed on the target clusters. If you have an existing cluster, you can deploy KubeSphere on it with a minimal installation so that it can be imported. See [Minimal KubeSphere on Kubernetes](../../../quick-start/minimal-kubesphere-on-k8s/) for details.
{{</ notice >}}

## Agent Connection

The component [Tower](https://github.com/kubesphere/tower) of KubeSphere is used for agent connection. Tower is a tool for network connection between clusters through the agent. If the H Cluster cannot access the M Cluster directly, you can expose the proxy service address of the H cluster. This enables the M Cluster to connect to the H cluster through the agent. This method is applicable when the M Cluster is in a private environment (e.g. IDC) and the H Cluster is able to expose the proxy service. The agent connection is also applicable when your clusters are distributed across different cloud providers.

### Prepare a Host Cluster

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "KubeSphere has been installed" >}}

If you already have a standalone KubeSphere installed, you can set the value of  `clusterRole` to `host` by editing the cluster configuration. You need to **wait for a while** so that the change can take effect.

- Option A - Use Web Console:

Use `admin` account to log in the console and go to **CRDs** on the **Cluster Management** page. Enter the keyword `ClusterConfiguration` and go to its detail page. Edit the YAML of `ks-installer`, which is similar to [Enable Pluggable Components](../../../pluggable-components/).

- Option B - Use Kubectl:

```shell
kubectl edit cc ks-installer -n kubesphere-system
```

Scroll down and set the value of `clusterRole` to `host`, then click **Update** (if you use the web console) to make it effective:

```yaml
multicluster:
  clusterRole: host
```

{{</ tab >}}

{{< tab "KubeSphere has not been installed" >}}

There is no big difference if you define a host cluster before installation. Please note that the `clusterRole` in `config-sample.yaml` or `cluster-configuration.yaml` has to be set as follows:

```yaml
multicluster:
  clusterRole: host
```

{{</ tab >}}

{{</ tabs >}}

You can use **kubectl** to retrieve the installation logs to verify the status by running the following command. Wait for a while, and you will be able to see the successful log return if the host cluster is ready.

```bash
kubectl logs -n kubesphere-system $(kubectl get pod -n kubesphere-system -l app=ks-install -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -f
```

### Set Proxy Service Address

After the installation of the Host Cluster, a proxy service called tower will be created in `kubesphere-system`, whose type is `LoadBalancer`.

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "A LoadBalancer available in your cluster" >}}

If a LoadBalancer plugin is available for the cluster, you can see a corresponding address for `EXTERNAL-IP`, which will be acquired by KubeSphere automatically. That means you can skip the step to set the proxy. Execute the following command to check the service.

```bash
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get svc
```

The output may look as follows:

```shell
NAME       TYPE            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)              AGE
tower      LoadBalancer    10.233.63.191   139.198.110.23  8080:30721/TCP       16h
```

Note: Generally, there is always a LoadBalancer solution in the public cloud, and the external IP can be allocated by the load balancer automatically. If your clusters are running in an on-premises environment, especially a **bare metal environment**, you can use [Porter](https://github.com/kubesphere/porter) as the LB solution.

{{</ tab >}}

{{< tab "No LoadBalancer available in your cluster" >}}

1. If you cannot see a corresponding address displayed (the EXTERNAL-IP is pending), you need to manually set the proxy address. For example, you have an available public IP address `139.198.120.120`, and the port `8080` of this IP address has been forwarded to the port `30721` of the cluster. Execute the following command to check the service.

```shell
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get svc
```

```shell
NAME       TYPE            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)              AGE
tower      LoadBalancer    10.233.63.191   <pending>  8080:30721/TCP            16h
```

2. Add the value of `proxyPublishAddress` to the configuration file of ks-installer and input the public IP address and port number as follows.

- Option A - Use Web Console:

Use `admin` account to log in the console and go to **CRDs** on the **Cluster Management** page. Enter the keyword `ClusterConfiguration` and go to its detail page. Edit the YAML of `ks-installer`, which is similar to [Enable Pluggable Components](../../../pluggable-components/).

- Option B - Use Kubectl:

```bash
kubectl -n kubesphere-system edit clusterconfiguration ks-installer
```

Navigate to `multicluster` and add a new line for `proxyPublishAddress` to define the IP address so access tower.

```yaml
multicluster:
    clusterRole: host
    proxyPublishAddress: http://139.198.120.120:8080 # Add this line to set the address to access tower
```

3. Save the configuration and restart `ks-apiserver`.

```shell
kubectl -n kubesphere-system rollout restart deployment ks-apiserver
```

{{</ tab >}}

{{</ tabs >}}

### Prepare a Member Cluster

In order to manage the member cluster within the **host cluster**, you need to make `jwtSecret` the same between them. Therefore, you need to get it first from the **host cluster** by the following command.

```bash
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get cm kubesphere-config -o yaml | grep -v "apiVersion" | grep jwtSecret
```

The output may look like this:

```yaml
jwtSecret: "gfIwilcc0WjNGKJ5DLeksf2JKfcLgTZU"
```

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "KubeSphere has been installed" >}}

If you already have a standalone KubeSphere installed, you can set the value of  `clusterRole` to `member` by editing the cluster configuration. You need to **wait for a while** so that the change can take effect.

- Option A - Use Web Console:

Use `admin` account to log in the console and go to **CRDs** on the **Cluster Management** page. Enter the keyword `ClusterConfiguration` and go to its detail page. Edit the YAML of `ks-installer`, which is similar to [Enable Pluggable Components](../../../pluggable-components/).

- Option B - Use Kubectl:

```shell
kubectl edit cc ks-installer -n kubesphere-system
```

Input the corresponding `jwtSecret` shown above:

```yaml
authentication:
  jwtSecret: gfIwilcc0WjNGKJ5DLeksf2JKfcLgTZU
```

Scroll down and set the value of `clusterRole` to `member`, then click **Update** (if you use the web console) to make it effective:

```yaml
multicluster:
  clusterRole: member
```

{{</ tab >}}

{{< tab "KubeSphere has not been installed" >}}

There is no big difference if you define a member cluster before installation. Please note that the `clusterRole` in `config-sample.yaml` or `cluster-configuration.yaml` has to be set as follows:

```yaml
authentication:
  jwtSecret: gfIwilcc0WjNGKJ5DLeksf2JKfcLgTZU
```

Scroll down and set the value of `clusterRole` to `member`:

```yaml
multicluster:
  clusterRole: member
```

{{</ tab >}}

{{</ tabs >}}


### Import Cluster

1. Open the H Cluster dashboard and click **Add Cluster**.

![Add Cluster](https://ap3.qingstor.com/kubesphere-website/docs/20200827231611.png)

2. Enter the basic information of the cluster to be imported and click **Next**.

![Import Cluster](https://ap3.qingstor.com/kubesphere-website/docs/20200827211842.png)

3. In **Connection Method**, select **Cluster connection agent** and click **Import**.

![agent-en](/images/docs/agent-en.png)

4. Create an `agent.yaml` file in the M Cluster based on the instruction, then copy and paste the deployment to the file. Execute `kubectl create -f agent.yaml` on the node and wait for the agent to be up and running. Please make sure the proxy address is accessible to the M Cluster.

5. You can see the cluster you have imported in the H Cluster when the cluster agent is up and running.
