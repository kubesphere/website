Air-gapped upgrade with KubeKey is recommended for users whose KubeSphere and Kubernetes were both deployed by [KubeKey](../../installing-on-linux/introduction/kubekey/). If your Kubernetes cluster was provisioned by yourself or cloud providers, refer to [Air-gapped Upgrade with ks-installer](../air-gapped-upgrade-with-ks-installer/).

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a KubeSphere cluster running v3.1.x. If your KubeSphere version is v3.0.0 or earlier, upgrade to v3.1.x first.
- Your Kubernetes version must be v1.19.x or later.
- Read [Release Notes for 3.1.1](../../release/release-v311/) carefully.
- Back up any important component beforehand.
- A Docker registry. You need to have a Harbor or other Docker registries. For more information, see [Prepare a Private Image Registry](../../installing-on-linux/introduction/air-gapped-installation/#step-2-prepare-a-private-image-registry).
- Make sure every node can push and pull images from the Docker Registry.


## Upgrade KubeSphere and Kubernetes

Upgrading steps are different for single-node clusters (all-in-one) and multi-node clusters.

{{< notice info >}}

KubeKey upgrades Kubernetes from one MINOR version to the next MINOR version until the target version. For example, you may see the upgrading process going from 1.16 to 1.17 and to 1.18, instead of directly jumping to 1.18 from 1.16.

{{< notice note >}}

[KubeKey](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey) uses `/var/lib/docker` as the default directory where all Docker related files, including images, are stored. It is recommended you add additional storage volumes with at least **100G** mounted to `/var/lib/docker` and `/mnt/registry` respectively. See [fdisk](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/fdisk.htm) command for reference.

### Step 1: Download KubeKey

Similar to installing KubeSphere on Linux in an online environment, you need to [download KubeKey v1.1.0](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey/releases) first. Download the `tar.gz` file, and transfer it to your local machine which serves as the taskbox for installation. After you uncompress the file, execute the following command to make `kk` executable:

```bash
chmod +x kk
```

### Step 2: Prepare installation images

As you install KubeSphere and Kubernetes on Linux, you need to prepare an image package containing all the necessary images and download the Kubernetes binary file in advance.

1. Download the image list file `images-list.txt` from a machine that has access to Internet through the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -L -O https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.1.1/images-list.txt
   ```

   {{< notice note >}}

   This file lists images under `##+modulename` based on different modules. You can add your own images to this file following the same rule. To view the complete file, see [Appendix](../../installing-on-linux/introduction/air-gapped-installation/#image-list-of-kubesphere-v310).

   {{</ notice >}} 

2. Download `offline-installation-tool.sh`.

   ```bash
   curl -L -O https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.1.1/offline-installation-tool.sh
   ```

3. Make the `.sh` file executable.

   ```bash
   chmod +x offline-installation-tool.sh
   ```

4. You can execute the command `./offline-installation-tool.sh -h` to see how to use the script:

   ```bash
   root@master:/home/ubuntu# ./offline-installation-tool.sh -h
   Usage:
   
     ./offline-installation-tool.sh [-l IMAGES-LIST] [-d IMAGES-DIR] [-r PRIVATE-REGISTRY] [-v KUBERNETES-VERSION ]
   
   Description:
     -b                     : save kubernetes' binaries.
     -d IMAGES-DIR          : the dir of files (tar.gz) which generated by `docker save`. default: /home/ubuntu/kubesphere-images
     -l IMAGES-LIST         : text file with list of images.
     -r PRIVATE-REGISTRY    : target private registry:port.
     -s                     : save model will be applied. Pull the images in the IMAGES-LIST and save images as a tar.gz file.
     -v KUBERNETES-VERSION  : download kubernetes' binaries. default: v1.17.9
     -h                     : usage message
   ```

5. Download the Kubernetes binary file.

   ```bash
   ./offline-installation-tool.sh -b -v v1.17.9 
   ```

   If you cannot access the object storage service of Google, run the following command instead to add the environment variable to change the source.

   ```bash
   export KKZONE=cn;./offline-installation-tool.sh -b -v v1.17.9 
   ```

   {{< notice note >}}

   - You can change the Kubernetes version downloaded based on your needs. Recommended Kubernetes versions for KubeSphere v1.19.8, v1.20.4, v1.20.6, v1.21.5, and v1.22.1. If you do not specify a Kubernetes version, KubeKey will install Kubernetes v1.19.8 by default. For more information about supported Kubernetes versions, see [Support Matrix](../../installing-on-linux/introduction/kubekey/#support-matrix).

   - You can upgrade Kubernetes from v1.16.13 to v1.17.9 by downloading the v1.17.9 Kubernetes binary file, but for cross-version upgrades, all intermediate versions need to be downloaded in advance. For example, if you want to upgrade Kubernetes from v1.15.12 to v1.18.6, you need to download Kubernetes v1.16.13 and v1.17.9, and the v1.18.6 binary file.

   - After you run the script, a folder `kubekey` is automatically created. Note that this file and `kk` must be placed in the same directory when you create the cluster later.

   {{</ notice >}} 

6. Pull images in `offline-installation-tool.sh`.

   ```bash
   ./offline-installation-tool.sh -s -l images-list.txt -d ./kubesphere-images
   ```

   {{< notice note >}}

   You can choose to pull images as needed. For example, you can delete `##k8s-images` and related images under it in `images-list.text` if you already have a Kubernetes cluster.

   {{</ notice >}} 

### Step 3: Push images to your private registry

Transfer your packaged image file to your local machine and execute the following command to push it to the registry.

```bash
./offline-installation-tool.sh -l images-list.txt -d ./kubesphere-images -r dockerhub.kubekey.local
```

   {{< notice note >}}

   The domain name is `dockerhub.kubekey.local` in the command. Make sure you use your **own registry address**.

### Air-gapped upgrade for all-in-one clusters

#### Example machines
| Host Name | IP          | Role                 | Port | URL                     |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| master    | 192.168.1.1 | Docker registry      | 5000 | http://192.168.1.1:5000 |
| master    | 192.168.1.1 | master, etcd, worker |      |                         |

#### Versions

|        | Kubernetes | KubeSphere |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Before | v1.18.6    | v3.1.x     |
| After  | v1.19.8    | v3.2.0     |

#### Upgrade a cluster

In this example, KubeSphere is installed on a single node, and you need to specify a configuration file to add host information. Besides, for air-gapped installation, pay special attention to `.spec.registry.privateRegistry`, which must be set to **your own registry address**. For more information, see the following sections.

#### Create an example configuration file

Execute the following command to generate an example configuration file for installation:

```bash
./kk create config [--with-kubernetes version] [--with-kubesphere version] [(-f | --file) path]
```

For example:

```bash
./kk create config --with-kubernetes v1.20.4 --with-kubesphere v3.1.1 -f config-sample.yaml
```

{{< notice note >}}

Make sure the Kubernetes version is the one you downloaded.

{{</ notice >}}

#### Edit the configuration file

Edit the configuration file `config-sample.yaml`. Here is [an example for your reference](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey/blob/release-1.1/docs/config-example.md).

   {{< notice warning >}} 

For air-gapped installation, you must specify `privateRegistry`, which is `dockerhub.kubekey.local` in this example.

   {{</ notice >}}

 Set `hosts` of your `config-sample.yaml` file:

```yaml
  hosts:
  - {name: ks.master, address: 192.168.1.1, internalAddress: 192.168.1.1, user: root, password: Qcloud@123}
  roleGroups:
    etcd:
    - ks.master
    master:
    - ks.master
    worker:
    - ks.master
```

Set `privateRegistry` of your `config-sample.yaml` file:
```yaml
  registry:
    registryMirrors: []
    insecureRegistries: []
    privateRegistry: dockerhub.kubekey.local
```

#### Upgrade your single-node cluster to KubeSphere v3.2.0 and Kubernetes v1.19.8

```bash
./kk upgrade -f config-sample.yaml
```

To upgrade Kubernetes to a specific version, explicitly provide the version after the flag `--with-kubernetes`. Available versions are:

- v1.19.0, v1.19.8, v1.19.9
- v1.20.4, v1.20.6
- v.21.5
- v1.22.1


### Air-gapped upgrade for multi-node clusters

#### Example machines
| Host Name | IP          | Role            | Port | URL                     |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| master    | 192.168.1.1 | Docker registry | 5000 | http://192.168.1.1:5000 |
| master    | 192.168.1.1 | master, etcd    |      |                         |
| slave1    | 192.168.1.2 | worker          |      |                         |
| slave1    | 192.168.1.3 | worker          |      |                         |


#### Versions

|        | Kubernetes | KubeSphere |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Before | v1.18.6    | v3.1.x     |
| After  | v1.19.8    | v3.2.0     |

#### Upgrade a cluster

In this example, KubeSphere is installed on multiple nodes, so you need to specify a configuration file to add host information. Besides, for air-gapped installation, pay special attention to `.spec.registry.privateRegistry`, which must be set to **your own registry address**. For more information, see the following sections.

#### Create an example configuration file

   Execute the following command to generate an example configuration file for installation:

```bash
./kk create config [--with-kubernetes version] [--with-kubesphere version] [(-f | --file) path]
```

   For example:

```bash
./kk create config --with-kubernetes v1.17.9 --with-kubesphere v3.1.1 -f config-sample.yaml
```

{{< notice note >}}

Make sure the Kubernetes version is the one you downloaded.
