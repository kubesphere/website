## Make Your Upgrade Plan

KubeSphere v3.1.0 is compatible with Kubernetes 1.17.x, 1.18.x, 1.19.x and 1.20.x:

- Before you upgrade your cluster to KubeSphere v3.1.0, you need to have a KubeSphere cluster running v3.0.0.
- If your exiting KubeSphere v3.0.0 cluster is installed on Kubernetes 1.17.x+, you can choose to only upgrade KubeSphere to v3.1.0 or upgrade Kubernetes (to a higher version) and KubeSphere (to v3.1.0) at the same time.
- If your existing KubeSphere v3.0.0 cluster is installed on Kubernetes 1.16.x or earlier, you have to upgrade Kubernetes (to 1.17.x+) and KubeSphere (to v3.1.0 ) at the same time.

## Before the Upgrade

{{< notice warning >}}

- You are supposed to implement a simulation for the upgrade in a testing environment first. After the upgrade is successful in the testing environment and all applications are running normally, upgrade your cluster in your production environment.
- During the upgrade process, there may be a short interruption of applications (especially for those single-replica Pods). Please arrange a reasonable period of time for your upgrade.
- It is recommended to back up etcd and stateful applications before in production. You can use [Velero](https://velero.io/) to implement the backup and migrate Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes.

## Upgrade Tool

Depending on how your existing cluster was set up, you can use KubeKey or ks-installer to upgrade your cluster. It is recommended that you [use KubeKey to upgrade your cluster](../upgrade-with-kubekey/) if it was created by KubeKey. Otherwise, [use ks-installer to upgrade your cluster](../upgrade-with-ks-installer/).
