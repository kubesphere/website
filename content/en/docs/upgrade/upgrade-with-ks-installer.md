ks-installer is recommended for users whose Kubernetes clusters were not set up by [KubeKey](../../installing-on-linux/introduction/kubekey/), but hosted by cloud vendors or created by themselves. This tutorial is for **upgrading KubeSphere only**. Cluster operators are responsible for upgrading Kubernetes beforehand.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have a KubeSphere cluster running v3.1.x. If your KubeSphere version is v3.0.0 or earlier, upgrade to v3.1.x first.
- Read [Release Notes for 3.1.1](../../release/release-v311/) carefully.
- Back up any important component beforehand.
- Supported Kubernetes versions of KubeSphere v3.2.0: v1.19.x, v1.20.x, v1.21.5, or v1.22.1.

## Apply ks-installer

Run the following command to upgrade your cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.1.1/kubesphere-installer.yaml
```

## Enable Pluggable Components

You can [enable new pluggable components](../../pluggable-components/overview/) of KubeSphere v3.2.0 after the upgrade to explore more features of the container platform.
