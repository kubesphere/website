In addition to installing KubeSphere on a Linux machine, you can also deploy it on existing Kubernetes clusters. This tutorial demonstrates the general steps of completing a minimal KubeSphere installation on Kubernetes. For more information, see [Installing on Kubernetes](../../installing-on-kubernetes/).

## Prerequisites

- To install KubeSphere v3.1.1 on Kubernetes, your Kubernetes version must be v1.17.x, v1.18.x, v1.19.x or v1.20.x.
- Make sure your machine meets the minimal hardware requirement: CPU > 1 Core, Memory > 2 GB.
- A **default** Storage Class in your Kubernetes cluster needs to be configured before the installation.

{{< notice note >}}

- The CSR signing feature is activated in `kube-apiserver` when it is started with the `--cluster-signing-cert-file` and `--cluster-signing-key-file` parameters. See [RKE installation issue](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues/1925#issuecomment-591698309).
- For more information about the prerequisites of installing KubeSphere on Kubernetes, see [Prerequisites](../../installing-on-kubernetes/introduction/prerequisites/).

## Deploy KubeSphere

After you make sure your machine meets the conditions, perform the following steps to install KubeSphere.

1. Run the following commands to start installation:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.1.1/kubesphere-installer.yaml
    
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/releases/download/v3.1.1/cluster-configuration.yaml
    ```

2. After KubeSphere is successfully installed, you can run the following command to view the installation logs:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kubesphere-system $(kubectl get pod -n kubesphere-system -l app=ks-install -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -f
    ```

3. Use `kubectl get pod --all-namespaces` to see whether all Pods are running normally in relevant namespaces of KubeSphere. If they are, check the port (`30880` by default) of the console by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc/ks-console -n kubesphere-system
    ```

4. Make sure port `30880` is opened in your security group and access the web console through the NodePort (`IP:30880`) with the default account and password (`admin/P@88w0rd`).

5. After logging in to the console, you can check the status of different components in **Components**. You may need to wait for some components to be up and running if you want to use related services.

## Enable Pluggable Components (Optional)

This guide is used only for the minimal installation by default. For more information about how to enable other components in KubeSphere, see [Enable Pluggable Components](../../pluggable-components/).
