## Objective

This tutorial shows you how to create a CI/CD Pipeline within DevOps project, which is intended for deploying a Spring Boot sample application to Kubernetes.

## Overview

Based on the existing Jenkinsfile in the sample GitHub repository, we can create a pipeline to build and complete the stages and steps (e.g. unit test, sonarqube analysis), which totally consists of eight stages as shown below.
