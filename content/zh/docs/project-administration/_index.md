A KubeSphere project is a Kubernetes namespace. There are two types of projects, the single-cluster project and the multi-cluster project. The former one is the regular Kubernetes namespace, while the latter one is the federation namespace across multiple clusters. As a project administrator, there are a bunch of work to do, such as setting project quotas, managing gateway, access control, etc.
