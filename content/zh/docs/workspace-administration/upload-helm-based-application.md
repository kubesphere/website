KubeSphere provides full lifecycle management for applications. You can upload or create new app templates and test them quickly. In addition, you can publish your apps to [App Store](../../application-store/) so that other users can deploy with one click. You can upload [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/) to develop app templates.

## Prerequisites

You need to create a workspace and `project-admin` account. Please refer to the [Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role](../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/) if not yet.

## Hands-on Lab

1. Sign in with `project-admin` account. Go to the workspace, open `Apps Management` and go to `App Templates`, then click the `Create` button.

2. Click the `Upload` button.

3. Assuming you've already developed a Helm chart locally, or you can download the example [Nginx package](/files/application-templates/nginx-0.1.0.tgz) here.

5. Now that you have successfully uploaded a Helm package, you can click on its name to go to its detail page.

6. On the versions list tab, you can click on the corresponding version to test the deployment.

You can also publish your application to App Store by following the [tutorial](../../application-store/app-lifecycle-management/) once you've fully tested your application.
